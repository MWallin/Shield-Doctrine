# Act I: Obsidian Station

## Opening: The Mysterious Breakthrough

Obsidian Station orbits a barren, airless planet in the Frontier Sector—technically Republic space but isolated, 3 weeks from the nearest fleet base via subluminal travel, or 8 hours via jump (when jump calculations are complete). Population: 142 researchers, 28 support staff, 80 Republic Legionaries.

The planet below is unremarkable—ancient impact craters, volcanic plains long dead, no atmosphere. But Dr. Adeyemi has made it a habit to visit the surface during his breaks. He calls it "contemplation time away from the station's recycled air."

Three weeks ago, he returned from one such surface expedition with unusual readings on his scanner. Something buried in an ancient crater—barely visible, partially melted into the regolith. He brought back a small object, perhaps 10 centimeters across, covered in strange geometric patterns. Not natural. Not obviously technological either, but definitely made.

He hasn't told anyone. Not yet. Not until he understands what it is.

But two weeks ago, while examining the object's quantum resonance patterns, something clicked. The patterns weren't random—they were modulating spacetime in ways his instruments could barely detect. A week of feverish work followed. And then the breakthrough: phase-variance shielding.

Initial tests show promise: objects wrapped in the field become nearly undetectable to sensors and pass through conventional energy shields and solid matter. The field lasts 90 seconds per charge, and phased objects cannot communicate electronically while active—but the implications are staggering.

Adeyemi prepares to transmit findings to Republic Command using the daily encrypted burst transmission. The mysterious object sits on his desk, its origins still unknown. He hesitates. Should he mention it? He doesn't even know what it is. Better to report the working technology first, then investigate the inspiration later.

As he finalizes the transmission, something nags at him. He pulls up the shield equations one more time, comparing them to his previous work. The power consumption curves follow patterns that shouldn't apply to phase-variance fields.

On impulse, he opens his archive of jump drive mathematics—research he'd done years ago during his doctoral work. The spatial distortion matrices. The dimensional folding coefficients. The gravitational interference patterns.

His hands freeze over the keyboard.

They match. Not perfectly—phase-variance operates at a different scale, different energy levels. But the underlying mathematical structure is nearly identical.

That shouldn't be possible. Jump drives compress space between two points. Phase-shields shift objects out of normal spacetime. Two completely different technologies with completely different purposes.

Unless they're not as different as everyone thinks.

He doesn't include this observation in his transmission. Not yet. It's probably just a coincidence. Similar problems sometimes yield similar solutions. He'll investigate further after the shield breakthrough is confirmed.

He transmits the shield data. The object goes into a secure storage container in his lab.

The mathematical similarity goes unmentioned.

## The Lab Session

Centurion Chen arrived at Dr. Adeyemi's lab at 0800 precisely, as she had every morning for the past three weeks. The collaboration had begun informally—Chen asking questions about the phase-variance project after a routine security briefing—but had evolved into something more systematic. Adeyemi valued her tactical insight. Chen appreciated working with someone who didn't treat military applications as an afterthought.

"Good morning, Centurion," Adeyemi said, not looking up from his workbench where a small test drone sat suspended in a containment field.

"Doctor." Chen set down his coffee and pulled up the previous day's test results on a secondary terminal. "You mentioned yesterday you'd narrowed the field instability issues. Success?"

"Partial. The emitter harmonics are responding better to the recalibrated power feed, but I'm still seeing fluctuations at the edge of the field boundary. Watch."

Adeyemi activated the generator. The drone—a simple reconnaissance model about thirty centimeters across—shimmered and vanished. Not invisible, but gone. Chen had seen this dozens of times now, but it still triggered her combat instincts: target lost, threat assessment uncertain.

She pulled out a combat scanner, standard Republic military issue. The kind that could detect powered equipment, heat signatures, even trace electromagnetic emissions. She swept it across the containment field.

Nothing. Absolute null return.

"I know the drone is there," Chen said slowly. "I just saw it when the field activated. From experience I know it will be there when the power runs out." She checked the scanner again, adjusted frequencies, tried different detection modes. "But my scanner tells me nothing. It just... vanished."

She lowered the scanner, something clicking in her tactical mind.

"Imagine if our camouflage worked like this. But then, this is more than camouflage—it can't be interacted with. It's more like..." She paused, searching for the right word. "More like a shield from my wildest dreams come true."

Adeyemi looked up, interested. "A shield?"

"Your technical term is 'phase-variance field,' right? But tactically, that's exactly what this is. A shield. Not deflecting or absorbing damage like conventional shields—it removes the protected object from the battlefield entirely. For ninety seconds, nothing can touch it."

"I hadn't thought of it that way," Adeyemi admitted. "I've been focused on the quantum mechanics, the field dynamics."

"May I?" Chen gestured to his notes.

Adeyemi nodded, and Chen scanned through the technical specifications. "Field duration is proportionate to covered area. Smaller objects can stay phased longer?"

"Correct. The power requirements scale exponentially with volume. This drone can maintain phase for ninety seconds with our current generator. Something person-sized would be... significantly less. Maybe thirty to forty seconds with the same power cell."

"Still enough time to cross a kill zone." Chen's mind was already running tactical scenarios. "And if they can't detect you, can't target you, can't shoot you..."

"You're thinking military applications."

"I'm thinking this changes everything about boarding actions. About defensive operations. About..." Chen caught herself. "Sorry. You're the scientist. I'm getting ahead of your research."

"No, please." Adeyemi deactivated the test field, and the drone reappeared. "This is exactly why I asked you to consult. I develop the technology, but you understand how it might be used. What are you seeing?"

Chen was quiet for a moment, watching the drone settle back into position. "In combat, the side that can maneuver unseen wins. Electronic warfare tries to achieve this—jam their sensors, blind their targeting. But they can still see you visually, still spray fire into likely positions. This..." She gestured to the generator. "This makes you genuinely untouchable."

"For forty seconds."

"Forty seconds to cross a corridor, position yourself, prepare an attack. Then you drop the field and they're facing enemies who are already in close quarters. Where our gladii work best."

Adeyemi smiled slightly. "From my wildest dreams, you said?"

"Phase-shield," Chen said definitively. "That's what this is. Not a field generator, not a variance modulator. It's a shield. The kind that legionaries dream about."

"Phase-shield." Adeyemi tested the word. "I like it. More practical than 'phase-variance modulation system.'"

"Soldiers like simple names for complex tech." Chen made a note in her tactical log. "One question, though. You said phased objects can't communicate electronically while in the field?"

"Correct. The phase-variance effect isolates the object completely. No electromagnetic radiation in or out. No radio, no sensors, no data transmission."

"So a team using these shields couldn't coordinate during the phased period?"

"Not electronically, no."

Chen nodded slowly. "That's a problem. Modern combat depends on real-time communication. Tactical networks, position updates, command coordination. Forty seconds without comms is a lifetime in a firefight."

"I'm working on it," Adeyemi said. "Perhaps a contained quantum-entangled link, or a localized field modulation that permits—"

"How about hand signals?"

Adeyemi paused. "Hand... signals?"

"Legionnaires train in non-verbal coordination. Electronic warfare, radio jamming—we drill for situations where comms go down. Line-of-sight hand signals, pre-arranged movement patterns, visual coordination." Chen pulled up a training manual on her datapad. "Standard Republic military doctrine since the First Generation. You can't always count on electronics."

"But you'd need to see each other. And we don't know if phased objects can even—" Adeyemi stopped. "Actually, we don't know that. I haven't tested whether two phased objects are visible to each other."

"Something to test?"

"Definitely." Adeyemi made notes. "Though I should mention, we have no idea about psychological effects. This technology has only been tested on objects. Drones, equipment, materials. Never living tissue."

"Concerned about biological compatibility?"

"More about the subjective experience. Being removed from normal spacetime, even briefly—we don't know how that feels. Disorienting? Painful? Psychologically damaging? I'd need years of controlled studies before risking human trials."

Chen looked at the test drone, then at the phase-shield generator. "Hopefully it stays theoretical for a while longer."

"Agreed." Adeyemi secured the equipment. "Though in my experience, once technology exists, someone finds a use for it faster than scientists prefer."

"That's why you have us," Chen said. "To make sure when that happens, we're ready."

## The Mess Hall Conversation

Two weeks before the attack, Chen found Adeyemi in the station mess hall during the evening meal shift, eating alone with a datapad propped against his water glass. The mess was half-full—researchers clustering in small groups, support staff grabbing quick meals between shifts, a handful of off-duty legionaries at the far corner table.

"Mind company?" Chen asked.

Adeyemi looked up, smiled. "Please. I'm just reviewing field harmonics. Not exactly riveting dinner conversation."

Chen sat, setting down a tray with the standard Republic military ration: protein, grains, vegetables, all nutritionally optimized and uniformly bland. "How goes the project?"

"Slow. Promising, but slow." Adeyemi set aside his datapad. "I'm starting to think practical application is still far off. Maybe years."

"What's the bottleneck?"

"Communication, primarily. We discussed it in the lab—phased objects can't send or receive any electromagnetic radiation. I've been trying to develop a workaround, but the fundamental physics are against me. Phase-variance isolation is absolute."

Chen chewed thoughtfully. "And you can't verify if phased objects can see each other yet?"

"Correct. Since we cannot get any signals out of the field, we haven't been able to confirm what the drone is seeing from inside the field. I'd need to put a camera inside, but then I couldn't receive the video feed until the field drops. At which point it's no longer a real-time test."

"Could you record it? Field activates, camera records what it sees, field drops, review the recording?"

"I could, yes. But that still doesn't solve the core problem for your theoretical tactical applications. Real-time communication during phase is impossible with current physics."

"Hand signals," Chen said. "I keep coming back to that. If phased objects can see each other—big if, I know—then legionnaires could coordinate visually. We train for it specifically."

"Electronic warfare scenarios?"

"And radiation environments, damaged equipment, enemy jamming. Any situation where you can't trust your electronics." Chen gestured with his fork. "Republic military doctrine emphasizes redundancy. Never depend on one system. We drill visual coordination protocols in basic training."

Adeyemi considered this. "But you'd need line of sight. In combat, with obstacles, smoke, chaos—"

"Not ideal, no. But functional. Legionaries work in tight formations specifically for this reason. Contubernium of eight can maintain visual contact even in difficult conditions. Pre-arranged signals for common actions: advance, fall back, flank, hold position."

"Still seems limiting compared to tactical networks."

"Absolutely. But even so, imagine the possibilities if we could communicate in some way while phased. Stealth infiltration, surprise attacks, defensive maneuvers—all with genuine invulnerability during movement." Chen paused. "Though I understand we're years from that. If ever."

"Probably more than years," Adeyemi said. "There are too many unknowns. The psychological effects alone—we have no idea how humans would react to phase-variance exposure. Disorientation? Nausea? Sensory disruption? I'd need extensive testing protocols, medical oversight, gradual exposure trials." He shook his head. "The Republic review boards would never approve human trials based on current data. Too risky."

"Rightfully so." Chen finished his meal. "Better to develop it properly than rush something dangerous."

"Thank you for understanding. Some of the more... enthusiastic... researchers have been pushing me to accelerate the timeline. They see the potential and want results immediately."

"Science doesn't work on demand."

"No, it doesn't." Adeyemi smiled. "Which is why I appreciate your consultation. You think about applications without demanding I solve everything tomorrow."

"That's what happens when you spend fifteen years as a legionary before earning your commission. You learn patience." Chen stood, collecting his tray. "Speaking of which, I have night watch in twenty minutes."

"And I have another three hours of harmonic analysis." Adeyemi raised his water glass in salute. "To slow, steady progress."

"To progress," Chen agreed.

As Chen left, Adeyemi returned to his datapad, already thinking about the camera recording test. Maybe if he synchronized multiple angles, he could at least confirm whether phased objects remained visible to each other.

It was a small step. But that's how progress worked: one small step at a time.

Behind the science, in unused maintenance sections of the station, other conversations were happening. Less formal. More desperate. And with consequences neither scientist nor soldier could yet imagine.

## The Meeting

In an abandoned section of Obsidian Station's lower maintenance level, two figures met in the dim emergency lighting. The corridor had been marked for upcoming refurbishment—new power conduits, environmental system upgrades—but the work hadn't started yet. It was perfect for privacy. No security cameras in sections undergoing reconstruction. No reason for anyone to be here.

"I told you this was the last time," one of them said, voice tight with stress. "This has gone too far."

The other figure pulled out a datapad, activating the screen. "This could be huge for science. The implications alone—"

"I don't care about implications. I care about not ending up in front of a tribunal."

"Just get me more details. Preliminary research only. Nothing classified." The datapad screen illuminated both faces briefly as files were transferred. "Dr. Adeyemi's breakthrough is remarkable, but I need context. How did he develop it? What was the inspiration?"

"There's something else." A pause, reluctant. "Something he found on the planet. An object. Strange geometry, unusual properties. He's been studying it."

The datapad holder went very still. "An object? What kind of object?"

"I don't know exactly. But he mentioned it might be related to the shield development. Some kind of... I don't know. Artifact, maybe?"

"Artifact." The word came out carefully controlled, but something shifted in the speaker's posture. Excitement. Recognition. "Can you get me more information? Radiation profile, material composition, scan data?"

"This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're pushing too hard, asking for too much—"

"Please. This is important. More than you realize."

A long silence. Then, reluctantly: "Fine. But this is the last time. After this, I'm done. You promised you'd destroy the evidence, get me clear of this whole mess."

"I will. I promise. Just this one more thing, and we're finished."

"That's what you said last time."

"I mean it this time. Just the artifact data, and we're done."

The two figures separated, moving through different sections of the abandoned corridor. One toward the research labs, carrying guilt and growing dread. The other toward the communication arrays, already planning how to relay this information.

An artifact. On Obsidian Station. After all this time searching, after all the dead ends and false leads—finally, a genuine find. The handler would pay extremely well for this information. Enough to clear the remaining debts. Enough to finally be free of this entire arrangement.

Enough to start over somewhere the Republic's long reach couldn't follow.

Just one more piece of information. Then it would all be over.

## The Murder

Six hours before the attack, two figures met again in the same unused maintenance corridor. Emergency lighting cast harsh shadows across equipment crates and half-installed conduit housing.

"This is everything," one said, handing over a small data drive. "After this, I'm done. No more meetings, no more information. You promised this would be the end."

The other figure accepted the drive, immediately connecting it to a portable terminal and beginning the copy process. "This is incredible. The radiation signature matches perfectly."

"Matches what?"

"Nothing. Just... this is good work. Very complete." The terminal beeped as data flowed. "The research on the shield technology alone is remarkable. And the artifact analysis—this is exactly what I needed."

"What do you mean, 'what you needed'? Who are you giving this to?"

"My contacts. The ones funding this."

"I thought you were just selling research to competitors. Industrial espionage, you said. Nothing serious."

"This is industrial espionage."

"Then why do you need artifact data? That's not commercial research, that's..." Suspicion crept into the voice. "What exactly are you doing with this information?"

The data copy completed. The figure disconnected the terminal, already planning the transmission sequence. "They'd have paid twice as much if I'd mentioned the shields with the coordinates. That sounds huge!"

Silence. Cold, absolute silence.

"...coordinates? What coordinates?"

The figure froze, realizing the mistake. "I meant—"

"You sent our location?!" The voice rose, panic and fury mixing. "To whom?!"

"You don't understand—"

"ANSWER ME! You sent our coordinates to someone? Who? Who did you send them to?"

"Look, they're just interested in the research. They won't—"

A shove. Hard enough to make the figure stumble backward. "You put everyone on this station at risk! For what? Money?!"

"Get your hands off me—"

Another shove, harder. "Tell me who you sent our location to!"

"I don't have to tell you anything!" The figure pushed back, panicking, desperate to end this conversation and get away. The shove was harder than intended.

A stumble. A loss of balance. The sickening sound of a head impacting the edge of a communication terminal.

Then stillness.

The figure stood frozen, watching the other's body crumple to the deck. Blood pooled slowly from the head wound.

"No. No, no, no—" Footsteps. Voices echoing from nearby corridors. The legionaries. The ones who used this section for combat drills. Coming closer.

Panic overrode everything else. Run. Get away. Clean this up later. The legionaries were almost here—

The figure ran, barely making it around a corner before two legionaries appeared in the corridor, their voices trailing off as they saw the body.

"Voices," one of them said. "Next section."

Then: "Oh, hell. We've got a body. Call it in."

In the shadows of an adjacent corridor, the figure kept running, heart pounding, mind racing. This wasn't supposed to happen. It was just supposed to be one more meeting. One more handoff. Then freedom.

Instead, there was a body. And legionaries. And no way to go back and fix this.

Later. Later there would be time to clean up the evidence, to erase the terminal records, to make sure nothing traced back.

But first: get away. Establish an alibi. Act normal. Pretend nothing happened.

The data drive in a pocket felt like it weighed a thousand kilograms.

Everything had just gone catastrophically wrong.

## The Investigation Begins

Decanus Rodriguez and Legionary Park had been testing emergency door reinforcement techniques—welding techniques for creating defensive choke points under time pressure—when they heard voices from the next section. Then the argument. Then the impact and the sudden silence.

They moved fast, weapons ready, following proper room-clearing procedures even though this was supposed to be an abandoned maintenance corridor.

The body lay on the deck beside a communication terminal. Blood pooling. A data drive still clutched in one hand.

Park checked for pulse, shook his head.

Rodriguez keyed his comm. "All stations, Third-Three. We have a body in Maintenance Section Seven-Delta. Appears to be... murder. I need Centurion Chen down here now."

Chen arrived four minutes later, assessed the scene in ten seconds, and immediately placed both legionaries on perimeter duty. "Nobody in or out until Lieutenant Tanaka gets here. This is a crime scene."

Tanaka arrived six minutes after that, her security officer instincts already cataloging details. A body. An encrypted data drive. Active communication terminals. An unused section where no one should be.

This wasn't random violence. This was operational security.

She photographed everything. The body—identified as Sarah Miller, support technician, no research clearance. The data drive—standard encrypted storage, the kind researchers used for transport between labs. But Miller was support staff. No reason to have this.

The communication terminals behind the body showed recent access logs. Someone had used these terminals two hours ago. Encrypted transmissions sent through external relays. Not standard procedure. Not authorized channels.

"Time of death?" she asked the medical technician who arrived moments later.

"Preliminary estimate: thirty to forty-five minutes ago. Single trauma to the head. Looks like she fell backward during a struggle, impacted the terminal edge there."

Tanaka examined the drive still in Miller's hand. The terminals. The unusual program she could see running in the background—taking up substantial processing capacity, doing something with the station's outbound data streams.

She pulled the access logs. Five people had keycards registering in this area within the last three hours who weren't assigned here:
1. Dr. Marcus Webb - Communications crew
2. Tech Specialist James Parker - Communications maintenance
3. Dr. Lisa Kwan - Xenobiology researcher
4. Legionary Davis - Off-duty
5. Support Tech David Park - Logistics

Five suspects. One dead technician. One encrypted drive. And something very wrong with those communication terminals.

"Decanus Rodriguez," Tanaka said. "Did you see anyone leaving this area when you arrived?"

"Negative, Lieutenant. We heard voices, argument, impact. Maybe twenty seconds elapsed before we got here. Whoever did this moved fast."

Tanaka called in a legionnaire with computer security training—Specialist Kim from Third Contubernium. Together they examined the terminals.

"This program," Kim said, pointing to a background process that should have been invisible but was consuming visible system resources. "This shouldn't be here."

"What's it doing?"

Kim pulled up the code, ran diagnostics. Twenty minutes of analysis while Tanaka photographed the scene and secured the data drive.

"It's piggybacking data onto outbound transmissions," Kim said finally. "Hiding information in routine scientific telemetry. Someone would need administrative access to install this. And it's sophisticated—should have hibernated after completing transmission, made itself invisible again."

"But it didn't?"

"No. It's still running. Still processing. Like whoever set it up got interrupted before they could shut it down properly."

Tanaka looked at the body. Miller died thirty to forty-five minutes ago. The program was still running. Whoever killed Miller ran before cleaning up their operational security.

"Can you trace what it was sending?"

Kim worked for another hour, Tanaka watching over his shoulder. The program had been active for months. Systematic transmissions. Most heavily encrypted, unbreakable without serious processing time.

But one transmission from three weeks ago used standard navigational encoding—coordinates, supply schedules, station population, research focus areas.

Kim cracked it in twenty minutes.

Obsidian Station's precise location. The weekly supply schedule. Station demographics. Research programs.

Sent to an external relay, bounced through multiple commercial nodes until the origin trail went cold.

Someone had told someone else exactly where to find Obsidian Station. When supply ships would arrive. What kind of research happened here.

Tanaka's blood went cold.

She checked current supply manifests. Commander Varro's task force was scheduled to arrive today. The schedule had been transmitted three weeks ago.

If someone wanted to attack the station when a supply convoy arrived...

Before she could finish the thought, proximity alarms screamed throughout Obsidian Station.

"Unknown ships dropping out of jump," the station monitoring officer announced over the general comm. "Attempting hail..."

A pause. Tanaka could hear the tension in the monitoring officer's voice.

"No response. But wait, what the hell, they're launching boarding shuttles."

Then the alarm klaxons.

"Hostile forces inbound. All civilian personnel to evacuation stations. All military personnel report to duty stations!"

The attack wasn't a coincidence. Someone had given them Obsidian's location. Told them when to strike.

And Tanaka had five suspects, one dead accomplice, and no time to investigate further.

She grabbed the encrypted drive and her investigation files. If they survived this, she'd need that evidence.

Then she ran for her duty station, already knowing this day was about to get much, much worse.
