Act 1 - Story

# Act I: Obsidian Station

## Opening: The Mysterious Breakthrough
Obsidian Station orbits a barren, airless planet in the Frontier Sector—technically Confederation space but isolated, 3 weeks from the nearest fleet base via subluminal travel, or 8 hours via jump (when jump calculations are complete). Population: 142 researchers, 28 support staff, 40 Confederation Legionaries.

The planet below is unremarkable—ancient impact craters, volcanic plains long dead, no atmosphere. But Dr. Adeyemi has made it a habit to visit the surface during his breaks. He calls it "contemplation time away from the station's recycled air."

Three weeks ago, he returned from one such surface expedition with unusual readings on his scanner. Something buried in an ancient crater—barely visible, partially melted into the regolith. He brought back a small object, perhaps 10 centimeters across, covered in strange geometric patterns. Not natural. Not obviously technological either, but definitely made.

He hasn't told anyone. Not yet. Not until he understands what it is.

But two weeks ago, while examining the object's quantum resonance patterns, something clicked. The patterns weren't random—they were modulating spacetime in ways his instruments could barely detect. A week of feverish work followed. And then the breakthrough: phase-variance shielding.

Initial tests show promise: objects wrapped in the field become nearly undetectable to sensors and pass through conventional energy shields and solid matter. The field lasts 90 seconds per charge, and phased objects cannot communicate electronically while active—but the implications are staggering.

Adeyemi prepares to transmit findings to Confederation Command using the daily encrypted burst transmission. The mysterious object sits on his desk, its origins still unknown. He hesitates. Should he mention it? He doesn't even know what it is. Better to report the working technology first, then investigate the inspiration later.

As he finalizes the transmission, something nags at him. He pulls up the shield equations one more time, comparing them to his previous work. The power consumption curves follow patterns that shouldn't apply to phase-variance fields.

On impulse, he opens his archive of jump drive mathematics—research he'd done years ago during his doctoral work. The spatial distortion matrices. The dimensional folding coefficients. The gravitational interference patterns.

His hands freeze over the keyboard.

They match. Not perfectly—phase-variance operates at a different scale, different energy levels. But the underlying mathematical structure is nearly identical.

That shouldn't be possible. Jump drives compress space between two points. Phase-shields shift objects out of normal spacetime. Two completely different technologies with completely different purposes.

Unless they're not as different as everyone thinks.

He doesn't include this observation in his transmission. Not yet. It's probably just a coincidence. Similar problems sometimes yield similar solutions. He'll investigate further after the shield breakthrough is confirmed.

He transmits the shield data. The object goes into a secure storage container in his lab.

The mathematical similarity goes unmentioned.

## The Leak
In the station's security center, Lieutenant Tanaka monitors communications as part of her routine duties. The burst transmission logs look normal. But Tanaka has a suspicious mind—it's why she went into intelligence work.

She runs a secondary analysis. There. Three days ago, an unauthorized piggyback signal, hidden in routine scientific telemetry. Someone transmitted station research data on an external channel. Not this breakthrough—this was before Adeyemi's success. But something was sent.

Before she can investigate further, proximity alarms scream. Krell ships dropping out of jump—their emergence signatures are unmistakable. Not a patrol—a strike force. Three heavy cruisers, two destroyer escorts.

Tanaka's blood runs cold. They knew. Someone told them.

But what did they know? The phase-shield breakthrough happened after the leak. So what information was sent?
No time to think. The Krell are here.

## The Assault
The Krell don't negotiate. Plasma lances cut through Obsidian's defensive grid in minutes. Some researchers make it to escape pods—the physics team, several junior scientists, a few technicians. They launch immediately with whatever data they grabbed, fleeing before Krell boarding pods hit the station.

The escape pod bay is in the outer ring. The Krell breach there first, cutting off that avenue of escape. The remaining personnel—120 researchers, staff, and all forty legionaries—fall back to the central hangar bays.

Krell shock troops sweep through corridors. Cybernetically enhanced, pain-immune, relentless. They're hunting something specific.

Lieutenant Chen's forty legionaries fight a desperate delaying action. Krell assault troops absorb standard weapons fire, continuing to advance even with catastrophic damage. Krell armor deflects kinetic rounds. The legionaries fall back in disciplined stages, buying time for the researchers to reach 
the hangar.

## Chen's Desperate Gambit
Chen and twelve legionaries hold the final chokepoint—a narrow maintenance corridor connecting the research wing to the hangar bays. They've exhausted kinetic ammunition. Krell advance in powered armor, servos hissing, optical sensors glowing red.

A Krell takes three shots to the chest and keeps coming. Chen's legionaries fix bayonets—ceremonial gladius blades, molecular-edge weapons that are last-resort tools. Good for close quarters but suicidal against armored cyborgs at range.

Dr. Adeyemi, trapped with them, makes a desperate decision. He has six prototype phase-variance generators meant for testing. And he has the mysterious object—he grabbed it when evacuating his lab. "I don't know if these will work on living tissue," he admits, distributing the generators to Chen's legionaries.

Chen understands instantly. "Activate on my mark. We can't fight while phased—weapons won't work. So we position ourselves, then power down, engage, and move. Use the gladius—get close."

The legionaries wrap the generators onto their armor. Chen checks his gladius—the blade hums as the molecular edge activates.

"Mark."

## The First Shield Combat
The generators activate. The twelve legionaries vanish—not invisible, but gone from normal space. The Krell's sensors lose target lock. Their infrared can't see the legionaries. Their audio sensors hear nothing.

The Krell pause, confused, weapons sweeping empty corridors.

Chen feels it immediately—a profound disorientation, like his inner ear has been removed. The world looks strange, colors shifted, perspectives wrong. He's trained for zero-g, for high-g, for every combat environment—but nothing prepared him for this. His stomach lurches. Two of his legionaries stumble, disoriented.

But there's no time. They're burning through 90 seconds.

Chen and his legionaries move forward, walking through the Krell formation. The sensation is nauseating—passing through solid matter feels like walking through thick syrup that doesn't exist. Intellectually he knows he's phased, but his brain screams that this is wrong.

They position themselves throughout the Krell formation. Eight Krell, twelve legionaries. Chen uses hand signals—his team can see each other while phased, and hand signals work perfectly. He points to targets, shows the attack plan.

The legionaries nod. Some look green, fighting nausea. But they're professionals. They'll do their jobs.

At forty seconds remaining, Chen signals: Ready.

At thirty seconds: On my mark.

At fifteen seconds: Now.

Twelve generators shut down simultaneously. Twelve legionaries materialize among the Krell—inside their formation, at point-blank range.

The Krell spin, but it's too late. Chen drives his gladius into a joint between helmet and armor collar—the only vulnerable point. The molecular edge cuts through like the material isn't there. The Krell drops, cybernetics severing.

His legionaries attack with brutal efficiency. Close quarters. No room for the Krell's plasma rifles—too bulky, too slow. The gladius blades are perfect for this—short, quick, devastating.

A legionary vomits inside his helmet—the phase disorientation catching up—but still manages to drive his blade through a Krell's knee joint. Another legionary staggers, head spinning, but recovers in time to parry a Krell's desperate strike with an armored gauntlet.

It's not a fight. It's a slaughter. Eight Krell in sixteen seconds.

Chen breathes hard, fighting his own nausea. "Report."

"Three wounded—nothing serious. Johnson puked in his helmet. Martinez can't stand straight."

"Get them to the hangar. We bought enough time."

##The Escape
Commander Varro's task force drops out of jump at the system edge—not in close orbit, because emergency calculations near a planet's gravity well are too dangerous. The cruiser Resolute and two frigates.

"Obsidian Station is under attack," her sensor officer reports. "Krell strike force in close orbit. I'm reading... escape pods. Eight of them."

"Retrieve the pods. Torres, can we jump in closer?"

Chief Engineer Torres shakes her head. "Not safely. We'd need two hours to recalculate for that planet's gravity well. And we don't have current gravitational data for that system—we'd be jumping blind."

"Then we go in on drives. Full acceleration. And get me those pods."

The frigates deploy to collect the escape pods while Resolute burns toward Obsidian. They're still 3 light-minutes out. At full acceleration, they'll reach orbital insertion in forty minutes.

On Obsidian Station, the survivors gather in the hangar bays. Dr. Adeyemi brings his phase-shield prototypes—all six were used, burned out, but he has the designs, the data, and the mysterious object that inspired them.

The Krell are breaching the hangar bays. Minutes remaining.

When Resolute's frigates recover the escape pods, they find terrified researchers and a treasure: the physics team evacuated with partial data on the phase-shields. Not complete, but enough to understand the basic principles.

Torres gets on comms with the surviving researchers on Obsidian. "How many phase-shield generators do you have?"
"None functional. All six burned out. But we have the prototypes—we can see how they work."

Torres thinks fast. "We have your transmitted data. We can build new ones, but it'll take time. How many people trapped?"

"One hundred sixty."

"Our shuttles hold thirty each. Six shuttles, five trips... too slow. The Krell will breach in minutes."

Adeyemi's voice crackles over comms. "The generators can be rebuilt. We have spare parts in the lab storage—power cells, emitter arrays. The researchers here, we can rebuild them, but it takes time. How long until you can reach us?"

"Thirty-eight minutes."

"We don't have thirty-eight minutes."

Varro makes a command decision. "We'll build generators here, send them to you on shuttles with phase-shields. 
Torres, how many can you build?"

"With what we have? Four. Maybe six if we cannibalize ship systems."

"Do it. Two per shuttle. One to reach the station, one to escape when loaded."

## The Risky Extraction
Torres and her engineering team work miracles. Fourteen minutes to build four functioning phase-shield generators. It helps that they have the partial data from the escape pods, the physical prototypes, and researchers who understand the theory.

Two shuttles launch from Resolute, each equipped with two generators. The plan is desperate: activate the first shield, fly through Obsidian's defensive perimeter and the Krell blockade, land in the hangar. Load personnel. Activate the second shield, escape.

Both journeys must be completed at full military acceleration—12 g's sustained. Anyone not strapped in properly will be injured or killed.

Shuttle One activates its phase-shield. The pilot, Lieutenant Morrison, feels the disorientation immediately but fights through it. She's got 90 seconds. She guns the engines to maximum thrust.

The shuttle phases through Obsidian's hull—strange, nauseating, but it works. She lands in the hangar with nineteen seconds to spare on the shield.

The personnel pile in—eighty people crammed into a thirty-person shuttle. Some standing, some sitting on others. No safety harnesses for most of them.

"Strap in if you can!" Morrison shouts. "This is going to hurt!"

The second phase-shield activates. Ninety seconds.

Morrison fires the engines at maximum thrust. Twelve g's. The standing personnel are crushed to the deck. Bones break. People scream. But the shuttle accelerates, phasing through obstacles, making for open space.

She clears the Krell perimeter with eleven seconds left. The shield drops. They're clear.

Shuttle Two executes the same desperate maneuver. More injuries. More broken bones. But they get another eighty personnel out.

## The Emergency Jump
Resolute recovers both shuttles. One hundred sixty rescued personnel, forty of them injured from the high-g extraction. The Krell cruisers are turning, weapons hot.

"Jump status?" Varro demands.

"Calculations incomplete," Torres reports. "We need another hour for a safe jump."

"We don't have an hour. Emergency jump. Now."

"Ma'am, emergency jump means we overload the cells with rough calculations. We'll appear... somewhere. Probably far from here. And we'll destroy our jump cells—we'll need to fabricate new ones before we can jump again."

"Do it."

Torres initiates the emergency jump sequence. She routes every available power conduit to the jump cells, feeds them energy far beyond design specifications. The calculations are rough—based on outdated star charts and incomplete gravitational data.

The jump cells scream warnings. Temperatures spike. Containment fields strain.

"Jump in three... two... one... jump!"

Space twists. Resolute and her two frigates vanish from Obsidian's orbit.

They emerge... somewhere. Deep interstellar space. No stars nearby. The sensor displays show nothing familiar.

"Jump cells destroyed," Torres reports. "We're stranded until we can build new ones. And we need to recalibrate our position before we can calculate a jump back to Confederation space."

"How long?"

"To fabricate new cells? Three days. To gather gravitational data and calculate a safe jump home? Another day. Four days total."

Varro nods. "Then we have four days to figure out what we've learned. And to ask Dr. Adeyemi some very pointed questions."

## Act I Closing
In the makeshift medical bay, as medics treat broken bones and phase-shock nausea, Chen and Varro review combat footage from his helmet cam.

They watch legionaries phase through solid matter, position themselves inside enemy formations, materialize at point-blank range for devastating gladius strikes.

"What if," Chen says slowly, "we didn't just use this defensively? What if we boarded them?"

Varro's eyes light up. "Get me Torres, Adeyemi, and every tactical officer on this ship. We need to war-game this."

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Tanaka begins her investigation in earnest. Someone sent unauthorized transmissions. Someone told the Krell about Obsidian Station—not about the phase-shields, which were developed after the leak, but something drew them there. She pulls comm logs, analyzes transmission patterns, and starts building a suspect list.

And in a secured cabin, Dr. Adeyemi examines the mysterious object he recovered from the planet's surface. Its geometric patterns seem to shift in the light. He doesn't understand what it is, where it came from, or who made it.

But he knows two things: it inspired the greatest breakthrough in military technology in a generation. And the mathematics underlying that breakthrough eerily mirror jump drive principles.

What does that mean? he wonders. And what else might it teach us?
