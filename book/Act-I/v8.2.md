# Act I: Obsidian Station
## Part 1: Opening

### Chapter 1: Obsidian Station

Obsidian Station orbited a barren planet in the Frontier Sector—technically Republic space, but isolated. Three weeks from the nearest fleet base via subluminal travel. Eight hours via jump drive, once the calculations were complete.

The station itself followed the Republic's standard Frontier Research Platform design: modular construction, expandable infrastructure, built for a century of service. Current population stood at 250: 142 researchers, 28 support staff, 80 Republic legionaries providing security.

Dr. Adeyemi had been here for eighteen months. Long enough to learn the rhythm of the place. Long enough to appreciate what the Republic Engineering Corps had built.

The station was still growing. Module Seven had been added six months ago—new fabrication facilities and an expanded computational center. Module Eight was scheduled for next year: additional living quarters and a secondary laboratory wing. The Republic planned infrastructure for the long term, and every upgrade brought the station closer to full Mark IV specifications.

Adeyemi appreciated that. Some frontier postings felt temporary, like the Republic might abandon them if budgets tightened or priorities shifted. Obsidian felt permanent. The Engineering Corps built things to last, and they came back to upgrade them.

The planet below was unremarkable by most standards. Barren, airless, tectonically dead. Ancient impact craters pocked the surface. Volcanic plains that had been cold for a billion years. No atmosphere to speak of—just trace gases and solar wind.

Most of the research team focused on the nebula two light-years away. Stellar formation, exotic chemistry, radiation effects. Important work that would fill journals and inform future missions.

Adeyemi studied the planet.

Not because it was interesting—it wasn't. But because it was there, and because sometimes a researcher needed to get away from the station's recycled air and constant hum of ventilation systems. He called it "contemplation time," which made his colleagues smile. But they understood. Everyone needed their own way to clear their head.

He'd take a shuttle down every few weeks. Land in different locations. Walk the surface in his environment suit. Look at rocks that hadn't moved in geological ages. Think about problems he was working on, or don't think about anything at all. Just exist in a space where the station's routines and constant activity felt distant.

The station ran efficiently because the Republic designed it that way. Standard layouts meant everyone knew where things were. Maintenance protocols kept systems running. Supply schedules delivered what was needed. The century of legionaries rotated duties without fuss—eight-year service commitments meant they were professionals, not conscripts.

It all worked. That was the Republic's genius, really. Build good systems, staff them with competent people, give them what they needed to succeed. Not glamorous, but effective.

Adeyemi had joined the Republic's Scientific Track twelve years ago, after his home system signed the integration accords. He'd been teaching planetary geology at a small university. The Republic offered him research positions, proper funding, access to facilities his university couldn't dream of affording. All it asked in return was twelve years of service—eight to earn citizenship, plus four more at his current salary grade.

A fair trade. He'd seen more of human space in twelve years than he would have in a lifetime teaching undergraduates. And in four more months, he'd complete his twelve years and earn full citizenship. Voting rights, the ability to hold elected office, full civic participation. Worth it.

The mess hall served decent food—better than military rations, not quite as good as planetside restaurants. The recreation facilities were adequate. His quarters were small but private. The research budget was generous. His colleagues were competent.

Everything the Republic promised, it delivered. That mattered.

On Tuesday morning, three weeks before everything changed, Adeyemi filed his weekly research summary. Mineral composition surveys from the southern highlands. Electromagnetic readings from an ancient impact site. Nothing remarkable. Steady progress on the baseline survey that would eventually inform the sector's geological database.

He checked the shuttle schedule. Number three was free that afternoon. He filed a surface expedition request—routine now, automatically approved.

Two hours later, he landed in a crater he'd never visited before. Seventy kilometers across, maybe three billion years old. The rim had eroded down to gentle slopes. Impact melt glass covered parts of the floor.

He walked for an hour, instruments recording, mind quiet. This was what he came for. The solitude. The scale. The reminder that human concerns were brief sparks against geological time.

He was heading back to the shuttle when his scanner registered an anomaly.

Not a strong signal—barely there at all. But distinctly not natural. The emission spectrum was wrong for volcanic rock or impact metamorphics. He stopped, checked his instruments. Still there. Very faint, but artificial. Or at least, not geological.

Curiosity overrode routine. He changed course, following the signal.

Twenty minutes of careful walking brought him to a section of the crater floor where impact melt had pooled and crystallized. The anomaly was buried in the regolith—not deep, just covered by three billion years of micrometeorite accumulation.

He used a sample scoop to clear the dust.

The object was small. Perhaps ten centimeters across. Covered in geometric patterns that didn't look human—too precise, too regular, following mathematical principles he'd need to analyze properly. Not natural geology, that was certain. Not obviously technological either, but definitely made.

He photographed it from multiple angles. Took spectral readings. Carefully extracted it and secured it in a sample container.

Then he stood there for a moment, holding something that shouldn't exist on this dead world, looking at patterns that suggested intelligence older than he wanted to contemplate.

He returned to the shuttle and filed a revised expedition report: "Unusual object recovered. Recommend analysis before including in regular survey data."

By evening, the object sat on his desk in the xenoarchaeology lab—a facility that had been added to the station's specifications three years ago, optimistically included for discoveries that might never happen.

Now he had something to analyze.

He didn't tell anyone yet. Not until he understood what it was. Could be nothing—some strange mineral formation his tired eyes had mistaken for patterns. Could be debris from an old probe. Could be a colleague's idea of a joke.

Or it could be something genuinely anomalous.

He'd find out. That's what researchers did. They looked at unknown things and figured out what they were looking at.

Outside his window, the barren planet turned slowly beneath the station. The nebula glowed in the distance. The Republic's frontier extended another research outpost into the void, building infrastructure and gathering knowledge, one unremarkable discovery at a time.

Usually.

### Chapter 2: The Artifact

For three days, the object told Adeyemi nothing.

It sat in the xenoarchaeology lab's primary examination chamber—a white composite sphere about ten centimeters across, covered in geometric patterns that seemed to shift depending on viewing angle and lighting. Precision-cut surfaces, mathematical regularity in the spacing. Definitely manufactured. Definitely not human.

But that was all he could determine.

Standard spectroscopy returned impossible results. The emission spectrum didn't match any known material. Density measurements kept fluctuating. The electromagnetic signature was wrong—not absent, not strong, just wrong in ways that made his instruments give contradictory readings.

Mass spectrometry suggested exotic matter. Crystallography said the structure shouldn't exist. Thermographic analysis indicated it was radiating heat, except his temperature sensors said it was ambient.

Nothing made sense.

On the fourth day, Dr. Sarah Miller stopped by his lab. She was part of the quantum physics team—young researcher, three years into her service commitment. Good with experimental setups.

"Still nothing?" she asked, looking at the object through the examination chamber's transparent wall.

"It's giving off readings," Adeyemi said, reviewing his data for the hundredth time. "I'm just not sure how to interpret them. It's like trying to read a book when you don't recognize the alphabet."

Miller studied the readouts. "That's a very subtle radiation profile. What's the wavelength?"

"That's the problem. It's not electromagnetic radiation in any standard sense. Something quantum-mechanical, maybe. But our instruments aren't designed for that kind of measurement."

"Hmm." Miller pulled up a chair. "You know, Dr. Zhang's team had a competition last week. Engineering challenge. Who could build the most sensitive quantum field analyzer."

Adeyemi looked up. "The experimental physics group?"

"Right. They got a bit childish about it, honestly. Built progressively more absurd prototypes trying to one-up each other. Dr. Chen won—his analyzer is supposedly generations ahead of anything else we have access to."

"How sensitive are we talking?"

"Ridiculously sensitive. Requires its own room of power cells and an insane level of isolation to produce meaningful results. They ran it once, measured some background quantum fluctuations, declared victory, and then shut it down because running it costs too much power."

Adeyemi stood up, looking at the object. Then at Miller. "Where is it now?"

"Storage, I think. Why?"

"Because if this object is manipulating quantum fields at levels our standard instruments can't detect..."

Miller's eyes widened. "You want to put it in Chen's analyzer?"

"I want to see what happens when we point the most sensitive quantum field measurement device on this station at something that's definitely doing something we don't understand."

Two hours later, after securing Dr. Chen's somewhat bemused permission and helping Miller move half a dozen power cells into the isolation chamber, Adeyemi placed the object in the analyzer's examination field.

They powered up the system. Capacitors charged. Isolation fields stabilized. The analyzer's display flickered to life.

And suddenly, the object made sense.

Not complete sense—Adeyemi was looking at patterns he'd need months to fully interpret. But he could see what it was doing. Quantum resonance patterns, modulating spacetime at scales so small his standard instruments couldn't detect them. The field extended maybe a millimeter beyond the object's surface—tiny, precisely controlled, impossibly complex.

"What is that?" Miller breathed, staring at the display.

"I have no idea," Adeyemi said. "But I can see it now. And if I can see it..." He started recording data, hands moving fast across the interface. "We can try to replicate it."

The next week was consumed by analysis. Adeyemi barely slept. Miller brought him coffee and helped run additional scans. Dr. Chen stopped by twice, fascinated by the readings his analyzer was producing.

The patterns weren't random. They were modulating spacetime according to mathematical principles Adeyemi recognized from his doctoral work on gravitational field theory. Similar to jump drive mathematics, but operating at completely different scales. Where jump drives compressed space between distant points, these patterns seemed to be shifting the object slightly out of phase with normal spacetime.

On day eight, Adeyemi thought he understood enough to attempt replication.

"This is insane," Miller said, watching him assemble a prototype field generator from laboratory equipment. "We're trying to reverse-engineer alien technology from a single artifact using instruments we built for a competition."

"Welcome to frontier research," Adeyemi replied, connecting the last power coupling. "Where else do discoveries happen?"

He'd recruited two more team members: Dr. Patel from the engineering group and Specialist Kim, one of the station's technical staff who had a talent for jury-rigging equipment. Together they'd built something that might—might—be able to generate the quantum field patterns he'd observed.

The prototype looked like amateur hour. Salvaged emitters. Power regulators pulled from unused laboratory equipment. Control systems running on Specialist Kim's personal tablet because they didn't have anything better.

"Moment of truth," Adeyemi said. He placed a coffee mug in the generator's field. "Everybody ready?"

Three nods. Miller had her scanner up, recording everything.

Adeyemi activated the generator.

The power cells discharged. The emitters hummed. Field strength climbed rapidly as the quantum patterns tried to establish.

The coffee mug vanished.

Not faded. Not became invisible. Vanished—completely absent from normal spacetime.

"Oh my god," Patel whispered. "Where did it go?"

"Still there," Miller said, checking her scanner. "I think. Sensors aren't detecting it, but the mass is still affecting local gravity very slightly. It's phased out somehow, but still physically present."

They watched the generator. Power levels holding. Field stable—

The circuit overloaded. Sparks flew. Specialist Kim hit the emergency cutoff.

The coffee mug reappeared, sitting exactly where it had been. Slightly warm from the field effect, but otherwise unchanged.

Four researchers stared at it. Then at each other. Then at the prototype generator that was now dripping coolant from a cracked power coupling.

The implications started to dawn slowly. Then faster.

"We just removed an object from normal spacetime," Adeyemi said quietly.

"For eleven seconds," Miller added, checking her recordings. "Until the power circuit burned out."

"Eleven seconds," Patel repeated. "Imagine if we could make that sixty seconds. Ninety. Could we do it with something larger than a coffee mug?"

"Could we do it with something person-sized?" Kim asked.

They looked at the prototype. At the artifact in the examination chamber. At each other.

Adeyemi pulled up his tablet and started documenting everything. "This is going to be a very interesting report for Republic Command."

In the corner of the lab, the mysterious object sat silent. Its quantum resonance patterns continued, precisely modulated, utterly indifferent to having been partially decoded. It had been doing this for an unimaginable length of time. It would likely continue doing it long after everyone on the station was dead.

But now, for the first time, humans had seen a glimpse of what it could teach them.

The real work was about to begin.

### Chapter 3: The Meeting

In an abandoned section of Obsidian Station's lower maintenance level, two figures met in the dim emergency lighting. The corridor had been marked for upcoming refurbishment—new power conduits, environmental system upgrades—but the work hadn't started yet. Perfect for privacy. No security cameras in sections undergoing reconstruction. No reason for anyone to be here.

"I told you last time we needed to slow down," one of them said, voice tight with stress.

The other pulled out a datapad. "I heard rumors. Something about Dr. Adeyemi finding something on the planet. Something unusual."

"You hear a lot of rumors."

"Are they true?"

A pause. Then reluctant: "He found an object. Brought it back three weeks ago. Strange geometry, unusual properties. That's all I know."

The datapad holder went very still. "An object? What kind of object?"

"I don't know exactly. He's been analyzing it in the xenoarchaeology lab. Won't talk about it much, says he doesn't understand it yet."

Inside, calculations spun fast. Years of waiting. Years of providing research data, hoping for the breakthrough that would change everything. This could be it. This could be exactly what the handler had been searching for.

Not just money anymore—though the debts were real enough. But the handler had hinted at more. Position. Recognition. A chance to join something important instead of always being on the outside looking in. The gambling problem had started with trying to fit in with the wealthy students. Nice restaurants, expensive social events, trying to belong to a group that never quite accepted someone from a frontier colony. The handler had understood that. Offered friendship first, help with the debts second, and then gradually, a business arrangement.

But now, maybe something more. The handler's organization was from a newly joined Republic member, looking for advantages to establish themselves. Someone who understood what it felt like to want to belong, to prove yourself worthy of acceptance. They'd need talented people. People who could deliver results.

This object could be that result. Leading a research division. Respected. Valued. Finally on the inside.

"I need more information," the datapad holder said, careful to keep voice controlled. "Could you get me analysis data? Radiation profiles, material composition, anything he's discovered about it?"

"This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're pushing too hard, asking for too much—"

"Please. This could be huge. Not just for my contacts, but for science. Think about what this could mean."

"I think about what it means for me if I get caught."

"You won't. You haven't yet. And after this, we might be done. My contacts just need to verify it's worth their attention. If it's not, we forget about it. If it is... well, they've hinted this could change everything. For both of us."

A long silence. Emergency lighting cast harsh shadows across equipment crates and half-installed conduit housing.

Finally, reluctantly: "I can try. But I'm serious—this needs to slow down. I didn't sign up for..." A gesture at the abandoned corridor, at the secrecy, at everything this had become.

"I know. I know. Just this one thing. Get me whatever data Adeyemi has on that object. Then we'll reassess. I promise."

"You said that last time."

"I mean it this time."

The two figures separated, moving through different sections of the corridor. One heading back toward the research levels, carrying guilt and growing dread. The other toward personal quarters, already planning how to relay this information.

An object. On Obsidian Station. The handler had been very specific about watching for xenoarchaeological discoveries. Very generous about payments when information proved valuable. This could be the big one. This could be freedom from the debts, yes, but also something better. Recognition. Position. A place where skills were valued instead of merely tolerated.

Just needed more information. Just needed to verify. Then everything would change.

The abandoned corridor returned to silence, emergency lights casting long shadows across equipment that wouldn't be installed for months yet. Outside, the station continued its routine. Inside, a betrayal continued its slow development, consequences still invisible, damage not yet done.

But building. Inexorably building.

### Chapter 4: Field Generator Development

Word spread fast on a research station.

Within two days of the coffee mug test, every researcher on Obsidian knew something remarkable was happening in Dr. Adeyemi's lab. Within a week, whatever their original research focus had been, most of them were finding ways to contribute to the field generator project.

The artifact itself faded into the background. It sat in its examination chamber, still mysterious, still undeciphered beyond that first layer of quantum resonance patterns. But the field generators—those were something humans could build, test, improve. Those were engineering problems with solutions.

And research stations attracted people who loved solving problems.

Dr. Zhang's engineering team took over power generation challenges. The original prototype had burned out its power coupling in eleven seconds. Could they extend that to thirty? Sixty? What about field stability under sustained load?

They built new power regulators. Tested different capacitor configurations. Ran simulations on field harmonics and discovered that certain frequencies caused destructive interference while others reinforced the phase-variance effect.

Dr. Patel's group focused on field emitters. The salvaged equipment from the first prototype worked, but barely. They designed purpose-built emitters, fabricated them in the station's machine shop, tested them systematically. Each iteration brought incremental improvement.

Specialist Kim ended up coordinating fabrication schedules because someone needed to manage the queue of researchers wanting machine shop time. The fab bays ran three shifts. Everyone wanted to test their variant, their improvement, their brilliant solution to whatever subproblem they'd identified.

Dr. Miller helped coordinate testing protocols. You couldn't just let everyone run experiments whenever they wanted—they needed standardized measurements, consistent conditions, proper data logging. She set up a schedule. Thirty-minute testing blocks. Document everything. Share results with the group.

The station's research had always been collegial, but this was different. This was all of them working on the same problem, building on each other's results in real time.

"Field duration up to forty-two seconds," someone would announce at the daily coordination meeting.

"We're at fifty-one with the new power coupling," another team would respond. "But the field boundary is less stable."

"Try the tertiary emitter configuration Dr. Zhang's team published yesterday. Might stabilize it."

And they would try it. And document the results. And share them. And someone else would iterate on that.

By week three, they had generators that could phase a one-cubic-meter volume for ninety seconds. Not perfect—power consumption was brutal, field boundaries still showed instabilities under certain conditions, and nobody was ready to test it on anything living.

But the progress was real. Measurable. Satisfying in the way that good engineering always was: identify problem, develop solution, test rigorously, iterate based on results.

The effects they discovered were fascinating from a pure science perspective.

Phased objects couldn't be detected by electromagnetic sensors. That was obvious from the first test. But they also couldn't interact with normal matter—a phased object would pass through solid walls as if they weren't there. The phase-variance field shifted the object just slightly out of normal spacetime. Close enough that gravity still affected it. Far enough that electromagnetic forces didn't.

Some of the physics researchers found that fascinating and started modeling the implications for quantum field theory. Others focused on the practical engineering challenges: power efficiency, field stability, emitter miniaturization.

Dr. Chen—the one whose analyzer had made the initial breakthrough possible—kept running comparative analyses. The phase-variance field mathematics looked similar to jump drive equations. Not identical, but related. Operating at completely different scales and serving different purposes, but possibly sharing some underlying principles.

He mentioned it to Adeyemi one afternoon, showing the mathematical parallels.

"Interesting," Adeyemi said, studying the equations. "But probably just convergent evolution. Similar problems sometimes yield similar solutions in physics."

"Probably," Chen agreed. "Though it's odd how many similarities there are. The spatial distortion functions. The power scaling relationships. Even some of the limiting factors."

"Worth documenting. But the field generators are the priority right now. If there's a deeper connection, we can investigate once the immediate technology is understood."

Chen nodded and went back to his modeling. The jump drive connection went into a footnote in his analysis report, potentially interesting but not immediately relevant.

By week five, the engineering teams had built seventeen different generator variants. Some optimized for power efficiency. Others for field stability. One experimental version that could phase multiple separate objects simultaneously if they were within two meters of each other.

Nobody had tried it on a living thing yet. Nobody even suggested it. Human trials were decades away, minimum. You didn't test unknown quantum field effects on people until you understood every possible consequence. That's what the review boards were for. That's how ethical research worked.

But hypothetically, if somehow you needed to phase something person-sized, the technology was starting to approach feasibility.

Hypothetically.

In the mess hall, conversation revolved around field harmonics and power coupling designs. In personal quarters, researchers ran additional simulations. In the machine shop, fabricators hummed around the clock building new prototypes.

Centurion Chen had noticed the station's energy in his regular security rounds. Something had the researchers excited. He'd asked Dr. Adeyemi about it during a routine check-in, more out of curiosity than concern.

Adeyemi had explained the basics: quantum field manipulation, phase-variance effects, objects shifting out of normal spacetime. Technical details that went over Chen's head, but the core concept was clear enough. Make things undetectable. Let them pass through solid matter.

Chen had listened carefully. Thought about what that might mean. Then asked if he could observe some tests.

That conversation had led to something more systematic. But that was still developing. For now, the researchers focused on their engineering challenges, building better generators through professional competence and systematic iteration.

Whatever else the mysterious artifact might teach them—whatever deeper secrets it held—that could wait. First, master what they'd already glimpsed. Do the work properly. Build the foundation before reaching for more.

One breakthrough at a time.

Outside, the barren planet continued its slow rotation. The artifact sat silent in its examination chamber. And on Obsidian Station, humans did what humans had always done: saw something new, figured out how it worked, and started building better versions.

---

### Chapter 5: The Lab Session

Centurion Marcus Chen arrived at Dr. Adeyemi's lab at 0800 precisely, as he had for the past two weeks. The collaboration had begun informally—Chen asking questions after that first demonstration—but had evolved into something more systematic. Adeyemi valued his tactical perspective. Chen appreciated working with someone who didn't treat military applications as an afterthought.

"Good morning, Centurion," Adeyemi said, not looking up from his workbench where a small test drone sat suspended in a containment field.

"Doctor." Chen set down his coffee and pulled up the previous day's test results on a secondary terminal. "You mentioned yesterday you'd narrowed the field instability issues. Success?"

"Partial. The emitter harmonics are responding better to the recalibrated power feed, but I'm still seeing fluctuations at the edge of the field boundary. Watch."

Adeyemi activated the generator. The drone—a simple reconnaissance model about thirty centimeters across—shimmered and vanished. Not invisible, but gone. Chen had seen this dozens of times now, but it still triggered his combat instincts: target lost, threat assessment uncertain.

He pulled out a combat scanner, standard Republic military issue. The kind that could detect powered equipment, heat signatures, even trace electromagnetic emissions. He swept it across the containment field.

Nothing. Absolute null return.

"I know the drone is there," Chen said slowly. "I just saw it when the field activated. From experience I know it will be there when the power runs out." He checked the scanner again, adjusted frequencies, tried different detection modes. "But my scanner tells me nothing. It just... vanished."

He lowered the scanner, something clicking in his tactical mind.

"Imagine if our camouflage worked like this. But this is more than camouflage—it can't be interacted with. It's more like..." He paused, searching for the right word. "More like a shield from my wildest dreams come true."

Adeyemi looked up, interested. "A shield?"

"Your technical term is 'phase-variance field,' right? But tactically, that's exactly what this is. A shield. Not deflecting or absorbing damage like conventional shields—it removes the protected object from the battlefield entirely. For ninety seconds, nothing can touch it."

"I hadn't thought of it that way," Adeyemi admitted. "I've been focused on the quantum mechanics, the field dynamics."

"May I?" Chen gestured to his notes.

Adeyemi nodded, and Chen scanned through the technical specifications. "Field duration is proportionate to covered area. Smaller objects can stay phased longer?"

"Correct. The power requirements scale exponentially with volume. This drone can maintain phase for ninety seconds with our current generator."

Chen did rough mental calculations. "What about something human-sized? Hypothetically."

Adeyemi considered. "With our current power cell technology? Maybe thirty to forty seconds. But that's purely theoretical—we haven't tested anything close to that scale."

"Still..." Chen's mind was already running tactical scenarios. Thirty seconds to cross a kill zone. If they can't detect you, can't target you, can't shoot you... "And if they can't see you, can't interact with you..." He caught himself. "Sorry. You're the scientist. I'm getting ahead of your research."

"No, please." Adeyemi deactivated the test field, and the drone reappeared. "This is exactly why I asked you to consult. I develop the technology, but you understand how it might be used. What are you seeing?"

Chen was quiet for a moment, watching the drone settle back into position. "In regular combat, the side that controls engagement range wins. Electronic warfare tries to blind sensors, but you can still visually spot enemies, still lay suppressing fire. This..." He gestured to the generator. "This makes you genuinely untouchable during movement."

"For thirty to forty seconds. Theoretically."

"More than enough time to reposition. And the ability to pass through solid matter—through walls, through barricades—that's enormous. Imagine being able to appear where your enemy doesn't expect you."

"You're thinking close-quarters combat."

"Where our gladii work best. If you could close with enemy forces without being detected, melee combat becomes viable again. Not just viable—devastating."

Adeyemi smiled slightly. "From my wildest dreams, you said?"

"Phase-shield," Chen said definitively. "That's what this is. Not a field generator, not a variance modulator. It's a shield. The kind that legionaries dream about."

"Phase-shield." Adeyemi tested the word. "I like it. More practical than 'phase-variance modulation system.'"

"Soldiers like simple names for complex tech." Chen made a note in his tactical log. "One critical limitation, though. You said phased objects can't communicate electronically while in the field?"

"Correct. The phase-variance effect isolates the object completely. No electromagnetic radiation in or out. No radio, no sensors, no data transmission."

Chen nodded slowly, the tactical excitement fading somewhat. "That's a significant problem. Modern combat depends on real-time communication. Tactical networks, position updates, command coordination. Thirty seconds without comms is a lifetime in a firefight. Without being able to communicate, coordinate, adapt... it limits applications severely."

"I'm working on it," Adeyemi said. "Perhaps a contained quantum-entangled link, or a localized field modulation that permits—"

"That sounds years away."

"It is. Decades, probably. And that's assuming the physics even allows it." Adeyemi secured his equipment. "I should also mention, we have no idea about biological effects. This technology has only been tested on objects. Drones, equipment, materials. Never living tissue."

"Biological compatibility concerns?"

"More about the subjective experience and long-term effects. Being removed from normal spacetime, even briefly—we don't know how that affects living organisms. Disorienting? Physically harmful? Psychologically damaging? I'd need years of controlled studies before risking human trials. The Republic review boards would never approve testing based on current data."

Chen looked at the test drone, then at the phase-shield generator. "So we're talking decades before this is ready for field deployment."

"At minimum. Even if we solved every technical challenge tomorrow, the approval process alone would take years. Safety protocols, ethical reviews, controlled testing programs. That's how responsible research works."

"Understood." Chen finished his coffee. "Still remarkable, though. Even if it stays theoretical for a long time, you've opened up possibilities nobody was thinking about before."

"That's what frontier research is for," Adeyemi replied. "Discovering what's possible. Figuring out how to use it safely—that's the next generation's problem."

Outside the lab, station life continued its normal rhythm. Inside, two professionals contemplated a technology that might someday change everything about combat.

Someday. Not today. Not for years, probably.

But someday.

### Chapter 6: The Briefing

Chen's century gathered for the weekly briefing in the station's main assembly room—all eight group leaders, plus Primus Pilus Kowalski. Routine check-ins, nothing urgent. Security updates, training schedules, maintenance reports. The kind of regular coordination that kept a military unit functioning smoothly.

"Any issues from your groups?" Chen asked, scanning the room.

Decanus Rodriguez from Third Group shook her head. "Emergency door reinforcement drills went well. We're still refining the weld tape technique—fifty-seven attempts now—but I think we're close."

"Remind me of the specs?" Chen asked.

"Five millimeter thick, steel mesh backing with thermite plastic mix. We apply it to the door seam, trigger with high current. When it works, it welds violently to the surface—about the thickness of the material plus one millimeter of mesh penetration. The idea came from one of the researchers watching our exercises. She worked with a station engineer on adapting emergency hull breach tape for doors."

"Previous attempts?"

"Burned clean through the door, or didn't ignite fully and left brittle welds. This iteration looks promising, but we need more trials."

"How many doors have you gone through in the testing area?" Chen asked.

Rodriguez grimaced. "More than I'd like to admit, sir. There's a distinct lack of intact doors in Section Seven-Delta."

"Use the maintenance section scheduled for reconstruction instead. Module refurbishment starts in three months anyway. Plenty of doors that are getting replaced regardless."

"That's perfect, sir. Thank you."

"Good. Keep at it." Chen made a note. "Second Group?"

Decanus Thompson reported on ammunition inventory and range qualification updates. Fourth Group had completed their combat swimmer refresher. Fifth Group was rotating through communications equipment maintenance.

All routine. All professional. Exactly how it should be.

"One more item," Chen said. "Some of you have probably heard station rumors about Dr. Adeyemi's research project. Phase-variance field generators—they're calling them 'phase-shields' now."

That got attention. Research station gossip traveled fast, but most legionaries didn't know details.

"I've been consulting with Dr. Adeyemi on potential military applications. The short version: the technology can make objects undetectable to sensors and able to pass through solid matter for thirty to forty seconds. Revolutionary potential for close-quarters combat."

Several group leaders leaned forward, interested.

"However," Chen continued, "there's a fundamental limitation. Phased objects cannot communicate electronically. No radio, no tactical networks, no real-time coordination. That limitation effectively prohibits field deployment for dynamic combat operations. Without communication, you can't adapt to changing situations. It's a desk general's dream—preplanned operations that execute exactly as designed—but we all know combat doesn't work that way."

He saw understanding on experienced faces. Plans never survived contact with the enemy. Adaptation was everything.

"So it's a fascinating technology that will likely remain theoretical for decades. Questions?"

Decanus Park from Second Group raised his hand. Young for a group leader—only six years in the Legions, promoted eight months ago. Still finding his footing, but competent.

"Sir, when you said no electronic communication, it reminded me of something."

"Go ahead."

"Last year, during my advanced infantry course, we had this training exercise. Instructors said an EMP had wiped out all our electronics, and there were biological agents everywhere requiring full hazard gear. Those things combined meant we couldn't talk to each other normally—radios down, can't hear through the suits properly, everything's a mess."

The room stayed quiet, letting him work through it.

"The instructors made us use hand signals. Old-school, line-of-sight only. And honestly? Once we got used to it, it worked way better than we expected. As long as we stayed where we could see each other, we could coordinate pretty well."

"How did the exercise go overall?" Chen asked.

Park grimaced. "We lost. Badly. Turned out we'd gotten way too dependent on our electronics. Going back to basics was harder than we thought. But the hand signals themselves worked fine—it was our rusty execution that was the problem."

Chen considered that. "So within line-of-sight, basic tactical signals function adequately?"

"Yes, sir. Advance, fall back, flank left, hold position—all the standard commands. Not as good as real-time comms, obviously, but functional if you train for it."

The room was quiet for a moment. Chen could see several group leaders thinking through implications.

"I'll mention it to Dr. Adeyemi," Chen said. "Though I should emphasize—we're talking about technology that won't see human trials for decades, minimum. This is all extremely theoretical."

"Understood, sir."

"That said," Chen continued, looking around the room, "it's a good reminder that we shouldn't let basic skills atrophy. All groups will integrate no-electronics drills into standard training. Not excessive—maybe one exercise per month. Just enough to keep everyone familiar with hand signals and non-verbal coordination."

Nods around the room. Made sense even without mysterious phase-shield technology. Electronics failed sometimes. Good to have backup procedures.

"Don't overdo it," Chen added. "I'm not trying to turn us into pre-technological infantry. Just making sure nobody forgets completely how to function when the fancy gear stops working."

"Anything else?" Chen scanned the group. "No? Then dismissed. Good work this week."

The group leaders filed out, already discussing training schedules and hand-signal refresher protocols. Park stayed behind briefly.

"Sir, should I have kept quiet about the exercise?"

"No, Decanus. That's exactly the kind of institutional knowledge we want to surface. Even if this specific technology never goes anywhere, the principle is sound—maintain basic competencies regardless of what advanced equipment we have available."

"Yes, sir."

After Park left, Chen sat alone in the assembly room for a moment, thinking. Hand signals. Simple, ancient, effective. Not a perfect solution—line-of-sight had severe limitations in combat environments. But if phased objects could see each other (and Adeyemi still didn't know if that was possible), it might work.

Worth mentioning. Probably wouldn't matter. But worth mentioning.

He pulled up his schedule. Next session with Dr. Adeyemi was tomorrow morning. He'd bring it up then.

Outside, Obsidian Station continued its orbit. Research continued. Training continued. Everything proceeding normally, professionally, systematically.

The way it was supposed to.

### Chapter 7: The Second Meeting

They met again two weeks later in the same abandoned maintenance section. Same emergency lighting. Same privacy. Same growing tension.

"You said you'd have the artifact data by now," the datapad holder said without preamble.

"Adeyemi's been busy with the field generator project. Everyone has. The artifact's barely been touched since the initial breakthrough."

"But you're on his team now, right? I heard you've been helping with the testing protocols."

A pause. "How did you know that?"

"Station gossip travels. You've been spending time in his lab, coordinating with other researchers. It's not exactly secret."

"It's legitimate research work."

"I'm not questioning that. I'm just saying—you have access. You're part of the team. Getting the artifact scan data should be straightforward."

"It's not that simple. The data is secured. Research-level encryption. And honestly, nobody's paying attention to the artifact anymore. The field generators are what everyone cares about now."

The datapad holder leaned forward, interested. "Tell me about the generators."

"Why?"

"Because if they're related to the artifact, my contacts will want to know about both. Context matters. They're not just collecting random data—they're trying to understand the bigger picture."

Reluctant: "We've built seventeen different prototypes. Phase-variance field generators—they can make objects undetectable and able to pass through solid matter. Duration depends on size and power supply. It's remarkable work."

"Military applications?"

"Centurion Chen has been consulting. He thinks it could revolutionize close-quarters combat eventually. But we're talking decades before human trials. The technology is nowhere near deployment-ready."

"Still..." The datapad holder made notes. "This could be valuable. Very valuable. My contacts would want to know about this research alongside the artifact data."

"This is exactly what worries me. You're escalating. First it was just general research data. Then the artifact. Now you want detailed technical specifications on potentially military-relevant technology?"

"It's all connected, don't you see? The artifact led to the generators. Understanding both gives the complete picture. And my contacts—they're scientists too. They want to understand, to contribute to human knowledge. That's all this is."

"Is it?"

A long silence. Emergency lights hummed. Somewhere distant, station ventilation cycled.

"I need those artifact scans," the datapad holder said quietly. "And whatever documentation you can get on the field generator research. Please. This is important. More important than you realize."

"Important how?"

"I can't explain. Not yet. But trust me—this could change everything. For both of us. The opportunity I mentioned before? This could make it real. A real position, real recognition. Not just debt relief, but actual professional advancement."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I mean it. But I need you to help me. Just this once more. Get me the data. Then we can reassess everything."

Another long pause. Then, finally, reluctantly: "I'll try. But this needs to be the last time. I mean it. After this, I'm done. Whatever you're building toward, you'll have to build it without me."

"Understood. Thank you. This means more than you know."

They separated again, moving through different sections. One carrying guilt that grew heavier with each meeting. The other carrying anticipation that grew stronger.

Soon. Soon this would all pay off. Soon the handler would see the value of what had been delivered. Soon everything would change.

Just needed the final pieces of data. Then it would all be worth it.

In the abandoned corridor, shadows lengthened. Outside, the station's routine continued. Inside, consequences accumulated like interest on unpaid debts.

Compounding. Inevitable.

Approaching critical mass.

---

### Chapter 8: The Mess Hall

Two days later, Chen found Adeyemi in the station mess hall during the evening meal shift, eating alone with a datapad propped against his water glass. The mess was half-full—researchers clustering in small groups, support staff grabbing quick meals between shifts, a handful of off-duty legionaries at the far corner table.

"Mind company?" Chen asked.

Adeyemi looked up, smiled. "Please. I'm just reviewing field harmonics. Not exactly riveting dinner conversation."

Chen sat, setting down a tray with roasted protein, seasoned grains, and vegetables that actually tasted like vegetables. The Republic understood that good food improved morale and performance. Research stations got decent provisioning—not restaurant quality, but far better than field rations.

"How goes the project?" Chen asked between bites.

"Slow. Promising, but slow." Adeyemi set aside his datapad. "I'm starting to think practical application is still far off. Maybe years. Possibly decades."

"What's the bottleneck?"

"Communication, primarily. We discussed it in the lab—phased objects can't send or receive any electromagnetic radiation. I've been trying to develop a workaround, but the fundamental physics are against me. Phase-variance isolation is absolute."

Chen chewed thoughtfully. "I mentioned this problem to my group leaders during our weekly briefing. One of them—Decanus Park—recalled a training exercise where they had to use hand signals after electronics failed. Said it worked better than expected within line-of-sight."

Adeyemi considered that. "Hand signals. Simple. Ancient. But you'd need to see each other, and we still don't know if phased objects are visible to each other."

"Could you verify that? Test whether multiple phased objects can observe each other?"

"In theory, yes. Put sensors inside the field, record what they detect, review after the field drops. But that's a separate research question, and honestly..." Adeyemi gestured at his datapad. "We have so many technical issues with the generators themselves. Field stability. Power efficiency. Emitter miniaturization. Solving the communication problem feels premature when we're decades from human trials anyway."

"Decades?"

"At minimum. Testing new technology on people requires extraordinary care, especially something that manipulates quantum fields and removes objects from normal spacetime. We'd need years of safety studies. Animal trials. Gradual exposure protocols. Medical oversight at every step." Adeyemi shook his head. "The Republic review boards exist for good reasons. They won't approve human trials based on 'we tested it on drones and coffee mugs.'"

"Rightfully so," Chen agreed. "Better to develop it properly than rush something dangerous."

"Thank you for understanding. Some of the more enthusiastic researchers have been pushing me to accelerate the timeline. They see the potential and want results immediately."

"Science doesn't work on demand."

"No, it doesn't." Adeyemi smiled. "Which is why I appreciate your consultation. You think about applications without demanding I solve everything tomorrow."

"Fifteen years as a legionary before earning my commission teaches patience." Chen finished his meal. "Speaking of which, I have night watch in twenty minutes."

"And I have another three hours of harmonic analysis." Adeyemi raised his water glass in salute. "To slow, steady progress."

"To progress," Chen agreed.

As Chen left, Adeyemi returned to his datapad, already thinking about the visibility question. Testing whether phased objects could see each other would require careful experimental design. Multiple synchronized generators. Precise timing. Proper instrumentation.

Worth investigating eventually. But not urgent. Not when the immediate challenges consumed all available time and resources.

One problem at a time. That's how good research worked. Systematic. Methodical. Building understanding layer by layer.

Behind the visible work, other dynamics continued their development. Webb pressured Miller for data. Miller struggled with growing guilt. The station's routine masked growing consequences.

But in the mess hall, over good food and professional conversation, two competent people discussed technology that seemed impossibly distant from practical application.

Revolutionary potential, yes. But decades away. Generations, maybe.

Safe theoretical work. Nothing that would matter anytime soon.

Nothing that could possibly go wrong.

### Chapter 9: The Murder

In an unused communication relay station on Obsidian's lower levels, two figures met for what would be their final exchange.

The relay had been decommissioned two years ago when new communication arrays made it redundant. Equipment still powered on—no reason to waste the station's infrastructure investment—but nobody used it anymore. The perfect place for privacy. Far from regular patrols, no security monitoring, a legitimate reason to be here if questioned.

One figure held out a data drive. "This is everything. Artifact radiation profiles, field generator specifications, Chen's tactical analysis. After this, I'm done."

The other took the drive eagerly, plugging it into a personal tablet. Data transfer initiated. Scrolling through files, eyes widening with each new document.

"This is incredible," breathed the recipient. "The radiation signature matches perfectly. This is exactly what they've been searching for."

Continuing to scroll, excitement building. "And these field generator specs—this is revolutionary. They'd have paid twice as much if I'd mentioned the phase-shields with the coordinates. That sounds absolutely huge!"

The other figure froze. "...coordinates? What coordinates?"

Silence. The kind that comes when someone realizes they've said too much.

"What coordinates?" Repeated, voice rising. "Answer me!"

"You don't understand, they're just—"

"You sent our location?!" Voice climbing toward panic. "To whom?!"

"I meant—it's not—" Stammering, trying to formulate an explanation that wouldn't sound like what it obviously was.

The second figure lunged forward, shoving hard. "ANSWER ME!"

Defensive instinct kicked in. A harder shove back, trying to create space, trying to escape the accusation and the sudden terrible realization of what this conversation meant.

During the struggle, hands grabbed the data drive, yanking it free from the tablet.

The harder shove connected. The second figure stumbled backward, still clutching the drive. Arms windmilling, trying to regain balance. Feet tangling.

Falling.

The back of the head struck the edge of a decommissioned communication terminal. Sharp corner, solid construction, terrible angle.

The sound was brief. Wet. Final.

The figure collapsed. The data drive flew from loosened fingers, skittering across the deck plating into shadows behind equipment racks.

Standing there, frozen. Breathing hard. Watching the figure on the floor not moving. Not breathing.

Distant sound penetrated the shocked silence. Footsteps. Voices. Getting closer. Legionaries on patrol—no, doing corridor drills. Rodriguez's group practiced securing sections in this area. Coming this way.

Panic overrode everything else. Move. Had to move. Had to get out before they arrived and saw this and everything came crashing down.

Where was the drive? There—no, shadows too deep, can't see properly. Voices getting closer. No time. No time.

One final desperate look at the figure on the floor. Then fleeing through the secondary exit, heart pounding, mind racing with rationalizations.

An accident. Just an accident. Self-defense. Didn't mean to push that hard. Not murder. Couldn't be murder.

And the drive—encrypted research data, automatically wipes after 24 hours. Standard security protocol for sensitive work. Even if they found it immediately, by the time they cracked the encryption—if they could crack it—everything would be gone.

Just stay calm. Act normally. Nothing suspicious. By tomorrow, the evidence would destroy itself.

In the communication relay station, the body lay still. The data drive lay in shadows, invisible to casual observation. Footsteps approached—Rodriguez and Park, running their standard room-clearing drill.

"—and when you breach, remember to check your corners. Even rooms you think are empty—"

Rodriguez stopped mid-sentence. "Hold."

Park saw it too. "Is that—"

"Contact Chen. Now. Tell him we have a situation in the old relay station. Possible casualty."

Within two minutes, more legionaries arrived. Within five, Centurion Chen was on scene, assessing, securing, calling for medical. Within ten, everyone understood this wasn't an accident.

This was a crime scene.

And somewhere on the station, a murderer tried to act normally, tried to breathe normally, tried to believe that encrypted data would erase itself before anyone discovered the truth.

Twenty-four hours. Just needed to survive twenty-four hours.

Then it would all be okay.

Everything would be okay.

---

### Chapter 10: The Investigation

Centurion Chen sealed the communication relay station within minutes of Rodriguez's report. Four legionaries at the entrance—nobody in or out without his direct authorization. The rest of Third Group established a wider perimeter, keeping curious station personnel away from the scene.

Inside, Chen knelt beside the body, careful not to disturb anything. Dr. Sarah Miller. He recognized her from Adeyemi's research team. Young researcher, three years into her service commitment. Competent with experimental setups, from what he'd heard.

Dead from blunt force trauma to the back of the skull. The decommissioned terminal's edge showed blood and tissue. The angle suggested she'd fallen backward with significant force.

"Centurion?" Rodriguez stood at the entrance.

"Secure this entire section," Chen ordered. "Nobody enters or leaves without documentation. Full lock down until we understand what happened here."

"Yes, sir."

"And get me Lieutenant Tanaka."

Rodriguez hesitated. "Sir, station doesn't have Vigiles assigned. No dedicated investigators."

"I know. But Tanaka's military intelligence, counterintelligence focus. Closest thing we have to an investigator. Get her here."

Within twenty minutes, Lieutenant Sarah Tanaka arrived with a field investigation kit that looked hastily assembled. Chen briefed her at the entrance before letting her inside.

"I don't have jurisdiction," Tanaka said bluntly. "Vigiles Service handles criminal investigations. I track security threats, foreign intelligence, operational security breaches. This looks like a personal dispute gone wrong."

"Look anyway," Chen replied. "Station's three weeks from anywhere. No Vigiles backup. You're what we have."

Tanaka studied the scene. Miller on the floor. Terminal with blood. Equipment racks casting shadows. The body positioned awkwardly, suggesting she'd fallen backward during struggle.

"Terminal's still powered," Tanaka observed. "Active session."

"Nobody's touched it."

Tanaka approached carefully, examining the display. Standard communication terminal interface. Login credentials still active—Miller's credentials, according to the header. But the terminal itself had been decommissioned. Why was anyone accessing it?

"I need a specialist," Tanaka said. "Someone who understands computer systems. This terminal shouldn't be accessible at all."

Chen called in Specialist Kim from station technical staff. Twenty minutes later, Kim arrived with diagnostic equipment.

"What am I looking at?" Tanaka asked.

Kim examined the terminal carefully. "This relay was decomm'd two years ago. Hardware still functional, but network access should be disabled. Let me check..." Fingers moving across diagnostic interface. "Someone reactivated it. Basic communication functionality. Deliberately hidden from network monitoring."

"Can you access whatever they were doing?"

"Working on it." Kim pulled up system logs, command histories, active processes. "This is going to take time. Security protocols are standard but I need to trace through multiple layers. Twenty, maybe thirty minutes?"

"Do it."

While Kim worked, Tanaka searched the relay station methodically. Standard crime scene procedure: photographs, measurements, evidence documentation. She found the data drive wedged behind an equipment rack, nearly invisible in shadows unless you were specifically looking.

"Centurion, I have something."

Chen examined the drive. Standard Republic issue, unmarked, encrypted. "Miller's?"

"Unknown. But it was near the body, hidden. Possible evidence."

The medical technician arrived—Legionary Williams from Sixth Group, trained in emergency medicine. Not proper Medical Service personnel, but frontier stations made do with what they had.

Williams confirmed the obvious: blunt force trauma, death likely instantaneous. "Full autopsy needs real Medical Service facility. I can document injuries, preserve evidence, but detailed analysis will have to wait until we get back to proper infrastructure."

"Do what you can," Chen said.

Thirty minutes later, Kim called Tanaka over. "Found something. Multiple unauthorized programs running in background. Data transmission protocols, encryption systems, automated piggybacking on outgoing station communications."

"Explain."

"Someone turned this terminal into a covert relay. Anything they put here gets encrypted and smuggled out with regular station traffic. Routine supply requests, research updates, personnel messages—normal communications we send constantly. These programs attach additional encrypted data packets. Receiving end just filters for the right encryption signature."

"How long has this been running?"

Kim checked logs. "Months. Maybe longer—some logs are overwritten. But I can see transmissions going back at least four months. Regular schedule. Weekly, sometimes more frequent."

"What was transmitted?"

"Encrypted. I can see packet sizes, timestamps, destination routing. But content is locked. This is professional encryption, military-grade or better."

Tanaka stared at the terminal. Data smuggling. Systematic, long-term, sophisticated. This wasn't a personal dispute. This was espionage.

"Can you decrypt it?"

Kim shook her head. "Not with station resources. Republic Intelligence HQ might be able to, given enough time and computing power. But that drive you found—if it's part of this system—it's encrypted with the same protocols. We'd need days, maybe weeks of computational analysis."

"How long until the drive auto-wipes?" Tanaka asked.

"Standard Republic security is 24-hour auto-deletion for sensitive data. Assuming this drive uses those protocols..." Kim checked the time. "If it was accessed around the time of death, we have maybe 18-20 hours before automatic wipe initiates."

Tanaka made a decision. "Bag it as evidence. We'll try to crack it, but priority is finding who else was involved."

She turned to Chen. "I need to interview everyone who had access to this section. Start with people who knew Miller, worked with her, had reason to be in unused areas."

Chen pulled up station rosters. "Adeyemi's research team—Miller was part of it. Station technical staff who might have legitimate access to decommissioned equipment. My legionaries run security patrols through all sections, including unused ones."

"I'll start with the research team."

Over the next four hours, Tanaka interviewed fifteen people. Adeyemi was shocked, devastated—Miller had been good at her job, enthusiastic about the field generator project. No indication of any problems.

Dr. Patel remembered Miller coordinating testing schedules. Professional, competent, kept things organized.

Specialist Kim confirmed Miller had legitimate access to most station systems as part of her research role. Data drives weren't unusual—researchers moved encrypted data between terminals constantly. Security protocols trusted cleared personnel.

Three suspects emerged through the interviews and security footage analysis:

**Dr. James Webb** - Communications specialist, worked with Miller occasionally on technical setups. Nervous during interview, alibi for time of death but specific details seemed rehearsed.

**Legionary Patricia Davis** - Fourth Group, regular patrol routes included unused sections. Access to terminal locations, familiar with station layout. But no apparent connection to Miller.

**Legionary Marcus Park** - Second Group (not the Decanus Park—different person entirely). Also ran patrols in lower sections. Mentioned seeing "someone" near old relay stations last week but couldn't provide details.

By evening, Kim had made more progress on the terminal analysis. "Found coordinates in one of the transmission logs. Not encrypted—looks like whoever was using this system sent them in plaintext, probably by accident."

"Coordinates to what?"

"Obsidian Station's exact position. Sent approximately three weeks ago to an external relay in neutral space."

The blood drained from Tanaka's face.

Three weeks ago. Long enough for someone to receive those coordinates, calculate a jump, prepare an assault force, and—

The station-wide announcement system crackled to life. Navigation Control, urgent broadcast.

"All personnel, unknown ships have entered the system. Multiple contacts detected on approach vector. Attempting to establish communications..."

Chen and Tanaka locked eyes. The coordinates. The data smuggling. Miller's murder.

It wasn't a personal dispute.

It was a security breach.

And whatever was coming had been invited here by someone on this station.

"Sound general quarters," Chen said, already moving toward the exit. "Get everyone to battle stations. Now."

Tanaka grabbed the evidence drive, Kim's preliminary analysis, everything they'd collected. The investigation would have to wait.

Something was coming.

And they were about to find out what.

### Chapter 11: Navigation Control

Specialist Hayes sat the navigation monitoring station, tracking routine sensor sweeps of Obsidian's orbital space. The most boring duty in the most boring job on a research station. Watch sensors. Log contacts. Report arrivals. Repeat.

The supply convoy was due today. Right on schedule—the Republic ran tight logistics. New equipment, food supplies, personnel rotation. Hayes had been looking forward to it. Mess hall food was fine, but after six months, even good meals got repetitive.

Sensor contact. Right on time.

Hayes initiated standard hail protocols. "Unknown vessels, this is Obsidian Station Navigation Control. Please identify and state your purpose."

Silence.

Odd. Usually convoys responded immediately.

"Unknown vessels, this is Obsidian Station. Requesting identification."

Still nothing.

Hayes checked the approach vector. Wrong. Convoy should be coming in from spinward, nice easy approach to the main hangar. These ships were on a shallow orbital intercept from anti-spinward. Weird, but maybe traffic conditions forced a different route?

"Maybe they're early?" Specialist Morrison suggested from the communications station. "Finally, actual resupply. I swear if I eat another iteration of synthesized vegetables, I'm filing a complaint."

Hayes smiled but kept monitoring. "Unknown vessels are not responding to hails. Running ID checks..."

The database returned nothing. Ship profiles didn't match Republic commercial registry. Didn't match military registry either. Private vessels, maybe? Independent transports sometimes did contract work for supply runs.

"Still not responding," Morrison said, trying different communication frequencies. "Equipment check?"

Hayes ran diagnostics. "Everything's green on our end. They're just not answering."

Then more sensor contacts appeared. Multiple ships, different vector—spinward approach, exactly where the convoy should be.

"Wait, what?"

New ships were broadcasting standard Republic identification. Supply convoy Delta-Seven-Four, requesting approach clearance, transmitting cargo manifests: fabrication materials, food stocks, replacement parts, medical supplies, six personnel transfers...

Hayes stared at two sets of contacts. The convoy where it should be. And unknown ships where they shouldn't be.

"Morrison, are we getting equipment malfunction? Double-contact errors?"

"Negative. I'm seeing it too. Two distinct groups."

The unknown ships continued their approach. Still silent. Still unidentified.

"This doesn't make sense," Hayes muttered. "Research stations don't have military-grade sensors. Maybe our equipment is glitching worse than diagnostics show?"

Morrison stood up. "We should borrow one of the research telescopes. Visual confirmation."

"The astronomers will love that."

"Better than reporting phantom contacts to Command."

Ten minutes of apologetic requests and mild arguing with annoyed researchers later, they had remote access to one of the observatory's optical telescopes. Hayes oriented it toward the unknown contacts, compensating for range and relative motion.

The image resolved slowly. Enhancement algorithms cleaned up the visual data.

Hayes went very still.

Wrong ship profiles. Not commercial. Not civilian. Military configurations—no, worse than military. These were assault vessels. Smaller ships clustered around larger troop carriers. And those hangar bay doors—

"Oh no."

Morrison leaned over his shoulder. "What is that?"

"Assault shuttles. They're deploying assault shuttles." Hayes switched views, magnifying the image. The hangar doors on multiple ships were opening. Small craft emerging, arranging into attack formations. "Those aren't supply ships. Those are—"

The unknown vessels launched kinetic slugs. Railgun fire, moving at a significant fraction of light speed. Then missile swarms—dozens of warheads accelerating toward the station.

Total silence in Navigation Control. Hayes and Morrison stared at the display, minds struggling to process what they were seeing. This was a research station. Frontier science outpost. Three weeks from anywhere important. Why would—

"Sound the alarm!" Morrison shouted. "Sound the fucking alarm!"

Hayes slapped the emergency alert. Station-wide klaxons activated. Red lights started flashing in every corridor.

Morrison grabbed the communications console. "All stations, this is Navigation Control. We are under attack. Unknown hostile forces inbound. This is not a drill. Repeat, we are under attack!"

Hayes switched to the command channel. "Centurion Chen, we are under attack. Multiple hostile vessels deploying assault shuttles. Kinetic weapons and missiles inbound. ETA..." He checked trajectories, hands shaking. "First impacts in four minutes."

Chen's voice came back immediately, crackling with adrenaline and barely-controlled profanity. "Shit. Shit shit shit. Sound general quarters! All personnel to evacuation stations! Security teams to defensive positions! Move move move!"

Throughout the station, alarms wailed. Researchers abandoned their work. Support staff ran for designated emergency stations. Legion

aries grabbed weapons and moved to defensive positions they'd drilled a thousand times but never expected to use.

In Navigation Control, Hayes and Morrison watched the assault force approach. Dozens of shuttles. Hundreds of missiles. Kinetic slugs that would punch through the station's civilian-grade hull like paper.

The supply convoy—the real supply convoy—was frantically broadcasting emergency calls, trying to understand what was happening. Too far away to help. Too far away to do anything but watch.

Hayes pulled up the evacuation protocols on his console. Escape pods. Shuttles. Emergency procedures he'd read during orientation and then forgotten because research stations didn't get attacked.

Four minutes until impact.

Three and a half minutes to get as many people as possible to safety.

It wasn't going to be enough.

On his display, the assault shuttles continued their inexorable approach. Behind them, the larger vessels repositioned for bombardment. Professional. Coordinated. This wasn't a raid. This was a planned military assault.

Someone had sent station coordinates to these people. Someone had invited this attack.

And now everyone on Obsidian Station was going to pay the price.

"All personnel," Hayes broadcast, voice surprisingly steady considering the terror he felt. "This is Navigation Control. Hostile forces inbound. Estimate four minutes to first contact. Evacuate immediately. This is not a drill."

Through the window of Navigation Control, he could see the barren planet below, rotating peacefully. The nebula glowed in the distance. The Republic's frontier research station continued its orbit, conducting science, building knowledge, doing everything the Stellar Republic stood for.

For three more minutes.

Then everything was going to change.

**End of Part 1: Opening**

*To be continued in Part 2: The Assault*
