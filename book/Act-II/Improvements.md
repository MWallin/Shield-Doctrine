What's Working in v5

Time Structure
The 6-week timeline from return to Confederation space through Typhon battle allows for systematic development. Shows progression from improvisation to doctrine.

Chen Boarding School Established (v5 major addition)
Named after **Legate Marcus Chen** (First Generation, 140 years ago, no relation to Centurion Chen). This is a significant v5 addition—establishing the training facility with historical context, showing it's part of ongoing tradition (lines 101-110).

Extensive Training Detail (v5 major addition)
v5 includes detailed training program (lines 99-296):
- 200 candidates, 6-month program
- Physical conditioning daily (PT, load marches, zero-g drills)
- Gladius training with 4kg practice blades (builds muscle memory)
- Phase training progression (30 seconds → 15 minutes over months)
- Formation drills until automatic
- Basic engineering for all legionaries
- Advanced boarding operations in final months

This is NOT a brief summary—it's ~3,000+ words of detailed training scenes showing Rodriguez's journey, Hassan's struggles, contubernium formation, instructor interactions, and systematic skill development.

Three-Wave Assault Doctrine Detailed (v5 major addition)
The **triplex acies** Roman formation adapted for modern boarding (lines 74-94):
- **Wave One - Vanguard (Hastati)**: Elite specialists, exceptional phase tolerance, establish beachhead
- **Wave Two - Main Force (Principes)**: Combat engineers + specialists, assemble anchors, hold ground
- **Wave Three - Consolidation (Triarii)**: Reserves flood through corridors, overwhelming force

Roman terminology explicitly used. The doctrine is explained, not just mentioned. This addresses what the improvement doc wanted.

Training Montage Shown (v5 major addition)
Week 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24 training scenes (lines 172-296):
- Physical conditioning with Rodriguez's team
- Gladius drills with practice blades
- Phase tolerance progression
- Formation drills and staggered materialization
- Pre-positioning protocols
- Three-wave assault coordination
- After-action reviews with lessons learned

Not told in summary—actually shown through character perspectives.

Torres-Adeyemi Collaboration Developed (v5 addition)
Mathematical connection between shields and jump drives explored in conversation scenes (lines 13-40, 300-329). Not just mentioned—we see them working together, discovering the patterns, theorizing warp corridors. Their friendship and institutional rivalry (Engineering vs. Scientific Track) shown.

Warp Corridor Theory Established (v5 addition)
Not just "they had an idea"—actual scenes of Torres and Adeyemi developing the theoretical framework (lines 300-329). They recognize phase-variance and jump-compression share mathematical foundations, theorize stable spatial bridges, understand gravitational constraints.

Technology Evolution Shown
Shield improvements feel earned: 90 seconds → 3-5 minutes through Torres' engineering work (lines 41-42). VLC development from improvised to standardized protocols. Specific technical progress demonstrated.

Senate Authorization Process (v5 major addition)
Detailed Senate debate scene (lines 336-378):
- Senator Marcus Torres vs. Senator Aria Chen arguing both sides
- Senator Rebecca Park's intervention about trusting commanders
- 182-118 vote recorded
- Tribune Marcus Webb exercising veto power
- Varro's professional assessment of risks
- Webb withdrawing veto after honest dialogue

This is a full dramatic scene, not exposition. Political process shown working through tension and debate.

Logistics Planning Session (v5 major addition)
Professional military planning with specific numbers (lines 380-408):
- Torres presenting detailed consumption data
- 50,000 kinetic rounds, 2,000 explosive charges, 4,500 micro-drones
- Power consumption per corridor: 15% carrier reactor output
- Ammunition expenditure projections: 60% usage per engagement
- Resupply timelines: 18 hours to nearest depot
- Medical capacity: 150 serious casualties, 400 minor
- Anchor pair constraints limiting simultaneous operations

This shows Industria (honest, diligent work) in action. Not handwaving—actual logistics management.

Citizenship Reform Passed (v5 major addition)
Three-tier system detailed with full political process (lines 415-444):
- **Civic Participant** (2 years): local voting rights
- **Regional Citizen** (4 years): sector governance
- **Federal Citizen** (6 years): full political rights

Senate debate shown: Senator Aria Chen presenting proposal, Senator Marcus Torres opposing, debate over standards vs. inclusion. Censors providing data on 180,000 vulnerable personnel. Assembly ratification: 4.2M to 1.8M. Tribune Marcus Webb commenting on Fides and acknowledgment.

This is fully developed, not "mentioned." Addresses Webb problem from Act I systematically.

Typhon Battle More Detailed (v5 addition)
20 phase-shielded shuttles, 240 personnel (not just small teams). Three-wave assault demonstrated on carrier Unrelenting with Chen's operation (lines 455-565). Boarding Group Delta failure shown—not just mentioned (anchor achieves only 40% synchronization, team fights 18 minutes without reinforcement).

Multiple Parallel Plots Working
Technology refinement (Torres), investigation (Tanaka), tactical development (Chen), political reform (Senate)—all interweave without feeling scattered.

Tanaka Investigation Deepened (v5 addition)
Webb's communication patterns analyzed (lines 47-70). Kwan identified as additional suspect (lines 58-59). Network structure being revealed. Systemic vulnerability understanding developing. This continues Act I's thread effectively.

What's Not Working (Still Needs Expansion in v5)

Six-Week Timeline Still Compressed
While v5 has excellent Week 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24 snapshots during training (lines 172-296), Weeks 1-5 development is summarized (lines 9-98). Need to show:
- Week 1-2: Infrastructure setup, first failures
- Week 3-4: Breakthrough and setback cycles
- Week 5: Scaling challenges

The training montage is good but happens in middle of 6-week period. Early development still compressed.

Individual Character Arcs During Time Skip
Rodriguez is featured in training (good!), but his development from selection through graduation could deepen. Hassan's screening failure and acceptance of support role mentioned but brief. Williams' technical mastery shown in exercises but his personal journey underdeveloped.

Kwan Arrest Not Shown
Dr. Lisa Kwan identified as suspect (lines 593-600) and arrested, but we don't see:
- Her perspective and motivations
- The arrest operation
- Interrogation revealing her reasons
- Tanaka's interaction with her
Currently it's efficient exposition, not dramatic scene.

Medical Aftermath Brief
Typhon casualties mentioned (lines 605-606) but treatment scenes minimal. We're told there are wounded but don't experience medical response, triage, specific injuries being treated, emotional impact on medical personnel.

Individual Boarding Operations Could Vary More
Delta group failure shown (good!), but other operations described collectively. With 20 shuttles boarding ships, there's opportunity for more varied scenarios—some easy wins, some hard fights, some creative problem-solving.

Post-Battle Emotional Processing Rushed
Battle ends, immediate assessment happens, Stone arrives—but where's the breathing room? Memorial service for casualties? Individual grief processing? Exhausted personnel dealing with what they just experienced?

Engineering Corps vs. Scientific Track Rivalry
Mentioned as factor but not dramatized much. Torres-Adeyemi collaboration starts to show this, but could expand. How do these institutional cultures actually differ? What tensions arise?

VLC Network in Practice
Described as important but not experienced degrading during combat. Should see communication network operating, then failing under fire, teams adapting to loss of coordination.
