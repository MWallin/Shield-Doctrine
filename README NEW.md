## Document Hierarchy (What's Canon?)

### **PRIMARY CANON (Must Respect)**

These documents define what IS in the Shield Doctrine universe:

1. **world-building/Shield Doctrine - Hard Constraints.md**
   Unchangeable physics, tech limits, mysterious elements

2. **world-building/Key Technology.md**
   Technical specifications for all major technologies

3. **world-building/The Stellar Republic - [11 documents]**
   Political, civic, military structure (Overview, Timeline, Citizenship, Service Branches, Government, General Service Structure, individual branch docs, military subfolder)

### **STORY (Current Versions)**

What's actually been written:

- **chapters/Act I - Story v8.md** - Current (aligned with Stellar Republic)
- **chapters/Act II - Story v5.md** - Current
- **chapters/Act III - Story v5.md** - Current
- **chapters/Act I - Story v6/v7.md** - Previous versions (reference)

### **STYLE & PROCESS GUIDES**

How to write consistently:

- **correctness/** folder - All style, tone, narrative guides
- **_process/** folder - Workflow and development processes

### **PLANNING (Infrastructure)**

How the story is structured:

- **planning NEW/** folder - Outlines, timelines, tracking
- **characters/** folder - Character arcs and relationships

### **WORKING MATERIAL (Not Canon)**

Development and exploration:

- **_notes/** - Active working notes
- **_archive/** - Completed development history
- **research/** - Background research

## Core Themes (Story Foundation)

1. **Professional Competence Overcomes Adversity** - Success through skill and training, not luck
2. **Earned Citizenship Creates Stakeholder Society** - Service grants political voice
3. **Infrastructure as Foundation of Civilization** - Roads, stations, systems matter
4. **Innovation Within Institutional Frameworks** - No maverick rebels, systematic improvement
5. **Mission Command: Decentralized Execution** - Subordinates execute with initiative
6. **Primary Group Cohesion** - Fight for comrades, not abstractions
7. **Technology as Tool, Not Solution** - Tech enables, people accomplish
8. **Mercy to Defeated Enemies (Clementia)** - Strategic and moral virtue
9. **Sacrifice in Service of Worthy Causes** - Costs honored but not glorified
10. **Mystery of Deeper Origins** - Ancient civilizations, unanswered questions

See **correctness/Story Themes Guide.md** for detailed explanations.

## Worldbuilding Pillars

### **The Stellar Republic (2750 CE)**

- **Government:** Federal republic with Senate, dual Consuls, earned citizenship
- **Military:** Professional volunteer Stellar Legions (Roman-inspired)
- **Service Branches:** 6 paths to citizenship (Engineering, Medical, Scientific, Civic Admin, Legions, Vigiles)
- **Citizenship:** 4 tiers (Non-Citizen → Junior Resident → Resident → Full Citizen)
- **Population:** 200-300 billion across 42 star systems
- **Technology Level:** Jump drives (recent), no FTL communication, phase-shields (new discovery)

### **Technology Constraints**

- **Jump Drives:** Spatial compression FTL, exponential energy cost, calculation vs. accuracy tradeoff
- **Phase-Shields:** Recently discovered, shift out of phase, no communication while phased
- **No FTL Comms:** Physical distance = communication delay
- **Hard Physics:** Consistent rules, no magic solutions

See **world-building/** folder for complete documentation.

## Writing Guidelines

### **Tone: Noblebright**
- Optimistic but realistic
- Competent people solving hard problems
- Institutions can be good (while imperfect)
- Sacrifice meaningful for worthy causes
- Technology serves people, not vice versa

See **correctness/Noblebright Tone Guide.md**

### **Style: Hard Military SF**
- Technical accuracy matters
- Show systematic problem-solving
- No deus ex machina solutions
- Respect intelligence of characters and readers
- Combined arms integration

See **correctness/Narrative Conventions Guide.md**

### **Roman Integration**
- Military: Centuries, centurions, gladius, systematic training
- Civic: Earned citizenship, Senate, infrastructure priority
- Cultural: Service ethos, professional development, clementia

See **correctness/Roman Principles Integration Guide.md**

---

## Version Control (Git)

### **Active Branch**
- Main branch: `main` (or `consistency/stellar-republic-alignment` currently)

### **Commit Guidelines**
- Commit every 30-60 minutes during active work
- After 500-1000 words written
- Before and after major changes
- Clear commit messages: "Act I: Add shield assault scene (lines 400-520)"

See **_process/GIT-WORKFLOW-FOR-WRITERS.md** for complete git workflow.

---

## Development Workflow

### **Active Development (Current)**
1. Work in **_notes/** for brainstorming/planning
2. Draft in **chapters/**
3. Reference **world-building/** and **correctness/** for consistency
4. Use **planning NEW/** infrastructure to stay organized

### **When Complete**
1. Extract useful material from **_notes/** to canonical docs
2. Archive development material to **_archive/**
3. Keep working directories clean

See **_process/MANAGING-DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md** for detailed workflow.
