# Shield Doctrine - Continuity Tracker

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Purpose:** Track what's been established IN THE STORY vs what exists in worldbuilding

---

## What This Document Is For

This document tracks what's been **shown, told, or established in the actual story** (not just in worldbuilding docs). It helps you:

- **Prevent contradictions** - What did you already say about this?
- **Avoid repetition** - Did you already explain this to readers?
- **Track character knowledge** - What does each character know at this point?
- **Manage reader knowledge** - What have readers been told?
- **Maintain consistency** - Descriptions, capabilities, etc. stay consistent

---

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:** You have extensive worldbuilding, but story ≠ worldbuilding

**Example:**
- **Worldbuilding says:** Centuries have 80 legionaries
- **Story might say:** "Chen commanded his 60-person century" (ERROR!)
- **Continuity Tracker catches this:** Shows you already established 80 in Act I

Without continuity tracking:
- ❌ You contradict yourself between acts
- ❌ You re-explain things readers already know
- ❌ Characters know things they shouldn't
- ❌ Physical descriptions change randomly
- ❌ Technology capabilities shift inconsistently

With continuity tracking:
- ✅ Consistent details across trilogy
- ✅ Character knowledge makes sense
- ✅ Efficient exposition (don't repeat)
- ✅ Readers trust you (no obvious errors)

## What Should Go In This Document

### **1. Technology Demonstrated (In Story)**

What tech has been **shown in action** (not just described)?

**Example:**
```
## Phase-Shields
**Act I:**
- Demonstrated on drones in lab (Adeyemi-Chen scene)
- Deployed on 8 legionaries (shield assault scene)
- Duration: [X] minutes before power failed
- Psychological effects: Nausea, disorientation (mentioned)
- Communication: Confirmed impossible while phased

**Act II:**
- [What new capabilities are shown?]
- [How long do they last now?]
- [How many people use them?]

**Act III:**
- [Mass deployment - how many shields shown?]
- [Any new limitations revealed?]

**Notes:**
- Don't contradict Act I duration without explanation
- Psychological effects should remain consistent
- Communication limitation is hard rule
```

---

### **2. Character Knowledge (What Do They Know?)**

Track what each character knows at different points to prevent knowledge leaks.

**Example:**
```
## Varro's Knowledge

**End of Act I:**
KNOWS:
- Phase-shields work in combat
- Webb was traitor with handler "Aurelius"
- Artifact trafficking network exists
- Emergency VLC jumps have 4-day consequences
- Chen's century suffered [X] casualties

DOESN'T KNOW YET:
- Mathematical connection between shields and jump drives
- Full extent of artifact trafficking
- [Other Act II/III revelations]

**End of Act II:**
KNOWS:
- [Add Act II discoveries]

DOESN'T KNOW YET:
- [What's still hidden until Act III?]
```

---

### **3. World Details Established**

Physical descriptions, capabilities, organization - anything specific you've **told readers**.

**Example:**
```
## Obsidian Station
**Established in Act I:**
- Research station on planet [Name?]
- Standardized Republic design
- Multiple sections, some unused for training
- One century (80 legionaries) stationed
- [X] civilian researchers
- [X] support staff
- Communication station where Miller died

**Important:** Don't contradict these details later!

## Republic Military Organization
**Established in Act I:**
- Century = 80 legionaries
- Centurion commands century
- Years of service for centurion: [X]
- Standard equipment: [What's mentioned?]
- Gladius: Molecular-edge blade (shown in combat)

**Established in Act II:**
- [Additional details]
```

---

### **4. Character Descriptions (Physical & Behavior)**

What have you **told readers** about each character?

**Example:**
```
## Centurion Marcus Chen
**Physical (Act I):**
- Male
- [Age mentioned?]
- [Physical description given?]
- [Rank insignia described?]

**Personality/Behavior (Act I):**
- Tactical thinker (shown in Adeyemi conversation)
- Protective of his legionaries
- Makes bold decisions under pressure
- [Other traits shown?]

**Background (Act I):**
- Years of service: [Mentioned?]
- Previous commands: [Mentioned?]

**Important:** Keep these consistent in Acts II-III!
```

---

### **5. Technology Capabilities (As Shown)**

What can technology **actually do** based on what you've shown readers?

**Example:**
```
## Jump Drives (As Demonstrated)
**Act I:**
- Can make emergency VLC jumps
- Consequence: Emerge far from intended destination
- Consequence: 4 days travel to reach system
- Cells destroyed by VLC jump (mentioned)
- Requires calculations (incomplete = inaccurate)

**What readers DON'T know yet:**
- Normal jump range
- Normal calculation time
- Number of cells per ship
- [Other tech details from Key Technology.md]

**Act II:**
- [What new capabilities are shown?]

**Rule:** Don't show capabilities that contradict Act I without explanation
```

---

### **6. Exposition Already Given**

What have you **already explained** to readers? (Prevents repetition)

**Example:**
```
## Republic Citizenship System
**Explained in Act I:**
- Service = path to citizenship
- Webb: 9 years served, needed 12 (this was the problem)
- [Was full system explained or just Webb's situation?]

**Explained in Act II:**
- [Additional details about reforms?]

**Rule:** Don't re-explain what Act I already covered unless there's a reason
```

---

### **7. Foreshadowing Planted**

What have you **hinted at** that needs payoff?

**Example:**
```
## Foreshadowing Tracker

**Act I:**
- Artifact has deeper mysteries (Adeyemi: "This is just the first layer")
- Aurelius handler exists, bigger network
- "Partners" mentioned in Webb's encrypted files
- Mathematical similarities between shields and jump drives hinted

**MUST PAY OFF IN:**
- Artifact mystery: Ongoing (trilogy+)
- Aurelius: Act II or III?
- Partners: Act II or III reveal
- Math connection: Act II (Torres-Adeyemi breakthrough)
```

## How to Use This Document

### **While Writing:**
1. **Before describing something**, check if you've described it before
2. **Before having character know something**, check if they should know it
3. **Before explaining to readers**, check if you already explained

### **While Revising:**
1. **Read through each act**
2. **Note everything established**
3. **Cross-check consistency** across acts
4. **Identify contradictions** to fix
5. **Mark repetitive exposition** to cut

### **Working with Worldbuilding:**
- **Worldbuilding docs** = What CAN exist
- **Continuity Tracker** = What HAS been shown
- Don't assume readers know worldbuilding!

## Common Continuity Errors to Watch For

- ❌ Character knows something they haven't learned yet
- ❌ Technology does something that contradicts earlier limits
- ❌ Physical description changes (hair color, age, etc.)
- ❌ Time/distance contradictions
- ❌ Re-explaining something readers already know
- ❌ Forgetting character appearances (character vanishes for 2 acts)
