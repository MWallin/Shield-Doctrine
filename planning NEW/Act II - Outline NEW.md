## What This Document Is For

This document provides a **detailed outline** of Act II, breaking it down scene by scene. For Act II specifically, this helps you:

- **Bridge Act I → Act II** - Track how threads continue from Obsidian
- **Manage the 6-week time skip** - What happens during training period?
- **Build to Typhon battle** - Ensure proper setup and escalation
- **Continue character arcs** - How do characters grow from Act I?
- **Develop Shield Doctrine** - From desperate improvisation to refined tactics

---

## Act II Special Considerations

Act II has unique challenges:

**Time Skip (6 weeks):**
- What happens during training?
- How do characters change in this period?
- What off-screen developments matter?

**Multiple Subplots:**
- Shield Doctrine development (Torres-Adeyemi collaboration)
- Tanaka's continued investigation
- Political pressure to scale up
- Systematic training and refinement
- Webb's tribunal (mentioned or shown?)

**Battle of Typhon:**
- First planned use of Shield Doctrine
- VLC (Very Low Confidence) jump
- Multiple simultaneous boarding operations
- Validation of training and doctrine
