# Shield Doctrine - Story Timeline

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Purpose:** Track when events happen across the trilogy to maintain consistency

---

## What This Document Is For

This document maps out **when events happen** in the Shield Doctrine trilogy, both the major plot events and the time between them. It helps you:

- **Maintain consistency** - Know exactly how much time passes between events
- **Track character positions** - Where is each character at each point in time?
- **Track character knowledge** - What does each character know at different points?
- **Plan logistics** - How long does it take to travel, train, build, etc.?
- **Avoid continuity errors** - Prevent "it's been 2 weeks" in one scene and "6 months ago" in another

---

## Why This Matters

Without a clear timeline:
- ❌ Time becomes vague and inconsistent
- ❌ Character knowledge gets contradictory (they know things they shouldn't)
- ❌ Training/manufacturing timeframes become unrealistic
- ❌ Readers notice when time doesn't make sense

With a clear timeline:
- ✅ Every event has a specific date/interval
- ✅ Character movements and knowledge make sense
- ✅ Logistics feel realistic
- ✅ Setup → payoff timing is intentional

## What Should Go In This Document

### 1. **Major Story Events with Dates**

Map all the key events with specific dates or intervals:

**Example structure:**
```
Year 2750, Day 0: Obsidian Station Attack
- Varro's task force arrives during attack
- Phase-shields deployed in combat for first time
- Webb's betrayal discovered
- Station destroyed, convoy escapes

Year 2750, Day 0-4: Stranded Convoy
- Emergency jump leaves them 4 days from nearest system
- Torres builds memory core reader
- Tanaka interrogates Webb
- Investigation continues

Year 2750, Day 5: Return to Republic Space
- Convoy arrives at [System Name]
- Varro reports to Command
- Webb handed over for tribunal
- Adeyemi begins formal phase-shield research

Year 2750, Day 5 - Week 6: Training & Development Period
- Systematic Shield Doctrine development
- 6 weeks of intensive training
- Torres-Adeyemi mathematical collaboration
- Boarding tactics refined

Year 2750, Week 6: Battle of Typhon
- First planned use of Shield Doctrine
- VLC jump + phase-shields deployed
- [Outcome and casualties]

Year 2750, Week 6 - Year 2751 (16 months): Expansion Period
- Shield Doctrine scales up
- More legions trained
- Manufacturing capacity grows
- [Other developments]

Year 2751 (16 months after Typhon): Battle of Hammerfall
- Multi-fleet operation
- Phase-anchor technology tested
- [Outcome]

Year 2751, Post-Hammerfall:

### 2. **Character Position Tracking**

For major characters, track where they are at key points:

**Example:**
```
## Varro's Timeline
- Day 0: In transit to Obsidian, arrives during attack
- Day 0-4: Commanding stranded convoy
- Day 5: Reporting to Command at [Location]
- Weeks 1-6: [Training location? Command meetings?]
- Week 6: Battle of Typhon [commanding what?]
- Months 6-16: [Where? Doing what?]
- Month 16: Battle of Hammerfall [role?]

## Chen's Timeline
- Day 0: Stationed at Obsidian, leads shield assault
- Day 0-4: Recovering on convoy, debriefing
- Day 5: [Where does century go?]
- Weeks 1-6: Training with new shield doctrine
- Week 6: Battle of Typhon
- etc.
```

---

### 3. **Character Knowledge Tracking**

Track what characters know at different points (prevents knowledge leaks):

**Example:**
```
## What Varro Knows
- Day 0: Phase-shields work, Webb is traitor, artifact exists
- Day 4: Webb had handler "Aurelius", broader network exists
- Week 6: [Mathematical breakthrough about shields/jump drives?]
- Month 16: [Everything discovered in Acts I-III]

## What Chen Knows
- Day 0: Phase-shields work in combat, psychological effects real
- Day 4: [Does he know about Webb? Investigation?]
- etc.
```

---

### 4. **Technology & Manufacturing Timeline**

Track when technology becomes available:

**Example:**
```
## Phase-Shield Development
- Year 2750, Pre-Day 0: Dr. Adeyemi discovers shields (weeks/months before attack?)
- Day 0: Prototype shields deployed (8 personal units)
- Weeks 1-6: Refined designs, small-scale production begins
- Week 6: ~50 personal shields available for Typhon
- Months 6-16: Mass production scales up
- Month 16: ~200/week production capacity (from Key Technology.md)

## Warp Corridor Development
- Week 6: Torres-Adeyemi breakthrough
- Months 6-16: Development and testing
- Month 16: First combat deployment (75% success rate)
```

---

### 5. **Inter-Act Events**

What happens between the acts that readers don't see but affects the story?

**Example:**
```
## Between Act I and Act II (Days 5 - Week 6)
- Republic Command debates Shield Doctrine adoption
- Other legions hear rumors, want to participate
- Political pressure to scale up vs. caution
- Tanaka continues investigation (what does she learn?)
- Webb's tribunal (mentioned in Act II)

## Between Act II and Act III (Week 6 - Month 16)
- Shield Doctrine proven, expansion authorized
- Manufacturing scales up (constraints noted)
- Political consequences (citizenship reforms begin?)
- [What else develops?]
```

## How to Use This Document

1. **Start with the major events you know** (Obsidian, Typhon, Hammerfall)
2. **Fill in the intervals** (6 weeks, 16 months)
3. **Add character positions** for each major event
4. **Track knowledge accumulation** (what do they learn when?)
5. **Note logistics** (travel time, manufacturing time, training time)
6. **Update as you write** - when Act I establishes something, note it here
