# Act I - Story Outline

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Current Version:** Act I - Story v8.md (aligned with Stellar Republic)
**Purpose:** Scene-by-scene breakdown to track structure and ensure all elements are working

---

## What This Document Is For

This document provides a **detailed outline** of Act I, breaking it down scene by scene. It helps you:

- **See story structure at a glance** - What happens in what order?
- **Track what each scene accomplishes** - Plot, character development, worldbuilding
- **Identify pacing issues** - Too much exposition? Not enough action?
- **Ensure setup/payoff** - Every element planted gets used
- **Make revision easier** - Know exactly what needs changing where

---

## Why This Matters

Without a scene-by-scene outline:
- ❌ Hard to see overall structure and pacing
- ❌ Easy to lose track of what scenes accomplish
- ❌ Difficult to revise (have to re-read entire act to find a scene)
- ❌ Setup can get lost (you plant something but forget to use it)

With a scene-by-scene outline:
- ✅ Can see structure problems immediately
- ✅ Easy to find specific scenes for revision
- ✅ Ensures every scene has purpose
- ✅ Tracks setup → payoff across act
