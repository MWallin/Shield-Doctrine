# Shield Doctrine - Plot Threads Tracker

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Purpose:** Track every plot thread across the trilogy to ensure setup → payoff

---

## What This Document Is For

This document tracks **every plot thread** in the trilogy from setup through payoff. It helps you:

- **Avoid dropped threads** - Every setup gets a payoff
- **Plan trilogy-level arcs** - Some threads span all three acts
- **Track mysteries** - What questions are raised and when are they answered?
- **Ensure satisfying resolution** - Readers don't feel cheated
- **Identify pacing** - Are payoffs too early/late?

---

## Why This Matters

Without thread tracking:
- ❌ You plant something in Act I and forget about it
- ❌ Payoffs feel random (no setup)
- ❌ Mysteries get dropped (readers notice!)
- ❌ Trilogy feels disconnected (acts don't build on each other)

With thread tracking:
- ✅ Every planted element gets used
- ✅ Payoffs feel earned (proper setup)
- ✅ Mysteries resolve satisfyingly
- ✅ Trilogy feels cohesive and planned
