## Beta Reader Process (Future Use)

### **Phase 1: Preparation**
1. **Complete self-editing** first
2. **Create Beta Reader Guidelines**
   - What are you looking for? (pacing, character, worldbuilding clarity)
   - What NOT to focus on? (grammar/typos if not final polish)
   - Context readers need (genre, themes, target audience)
3. **Prepare Questionnaire**
   - Specific questions about pacing, characters, plot
   - Open-ended questions for general impressions
   - Focus areas you're worried about

### **Phase 2: Recruitment**
1. Find 3-6 beta readers
2. Mix of backgrounds (military sci-fi fans, general readers, etc.)
3. Send guidelines + manuscript
4. Set timeline (2-4 weeks typical)

### **Phase 3: Collection**
1. Receive feedback in various forms (docs, emails, comments)
2. Create individual feedback files for each reader
3. Don't respond defensively—thank them!

### **Phase 4: Analysis**
1. **Create Feedback Summary**
   - What did multiple readers say? (patterns matter!)
   - What's one reader's opinion vs. consensus?
   - Which feedback aligns with your concerns?
2. **Prioritize issues:**
   - Critical: Multiple readers mention, or major structural issue
   - Important: Significant but limited impact
   - Consider: Interesting ideas but not essential
   - Ignore: Contradicts your vision or only one reader

### **Phase 5: Revision**
1. Create revision checklists per act
2. Track which feedback you're addressing
3. Note why you're NOT addressing some feedback (that's okay!)
4. Implement revisions systematically

### **Phase 6: Optional Round 2**
1. If major changes, consider second beta round
2. Focus new beta readers on changes
3. Verify fixes worked
