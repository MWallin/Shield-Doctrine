Gre# Act I: Obsidian Station

## Opening: The Mysterious Breakthrough
Obsidian Station orbits a barren, airless planet in the Frontier Sector—technically Confederation space but isolated, 3 weeks from the nearest fleet base via subluminal travel, or 8 hours via jump (when jump calculations are complete). Population: 142 researchers, 28 support staff, 80 Confederation Legionaries.

The planet below is unremarkable—ancient impact craters, volcanic plains long dead, no atmosphere. But Dr. Adeyemi has made it a habit to visit the surface during his breaks. He calls it "contemplation time away from the station's recycled air."

Three weeks ago, he returned from one such surface expedition with unusual readings on his scanner. Something buried in an ancient crater—barely visible, partially melted into the regolith. He brought back a small object, perhaps 10 centimeters across, covered in strange geometric patterns. Not natural. Not obviously technological either, but definitely made.

He hasn't told anyone. Not yet. Not until he understands what it is.

But two weeks ago, while examining the object's quantum resonance patterns, something clicked. The patterns weren't random—they were modulating spacetime in ways his instruments could barely detect. A week of feverish work followed. And then the breakthrough: phase-variance shielding.

Initial tests show promise: objects wrapped in the field become nearly undetectable to sensors and pass through conventional energy shields and solid matter. The field lasts 90 seconds per charge, and phased objects cannot communicate electronically while active—but the implications are staggering.

Adeyemi prepares to transmit findings to Confederation Command using the daily encrypted burst transmission. The mysterious object sits on his desk, its origins still unknown. He hesitates. Should he mention it? He doesn't even know what it is. Better to report the working technology first, then investigate the inspiration later.

As he finalizes the transmission, something nags at him. He pulls up the shield equations one more time, comparing them to his previous work. The power consumption curves follow patterns that shouldn't apply to phase-variance fields.

On impulse, he opens his archive of jump drive mathematics—research he'd done years ago during his doctoral work. The spatial distortion matrices. The dimensional folding coefficients. The gravitational interference patterns.

His hands freeze over the keyboard.

They match. Not perfectly—phase-variance operates at a different scale, different energy levels. But the underlying mathematical structure is nearly identical.

That shouldn't be possible. Jump drives compress space between two points. Phase-shields shift objects out of normal spacetime. Two completely different technologies with completely different purposes.

Unless they're not as different as everyone thinks.

He doesn't include this observation in his transmission. Not yet. It's probably just a coincidence. Similar problems sometimes yield similar solutions. He'll investigate further after the shield breakthrough is confirmed.

He transmits the shield data. The object goes into a secure storage container in his lab.

The mathematical similarity goes unmentioned.

## The Murder

Two legionaries from Third Contubernium were testing a new welding technique for emergency door reinforcement—something Sergeant Kowalski wanted evaluated before approving it fleet-wide. The technique used directed plasma to fuse structural plates in under thirty seconds, creating barriers that could buy precious time during boarding actions.

Decanus Rodriguez and Legionary Park worked methodically through an abandoned maintenance corridor on Obsidian's lower level, marking potential chokepoints and timing their welds.

"Voices," Park said suddenly. "Next section."

Rodriguez held up a hand. Listening. Raised voices. An argument. Then a sound—impact, struggle, cut short.

They moved fast, weapons ready. Around the corner: a body on the deck, blood pooling. A data drive clutched in one hand.

Park checked for pulse. Shook his head.

The body belonged to Sarah Miller, a support technician with no research clearance. The drive in her hand was encrypted research storage. And the room behind her had communication terminals, recently accessed.

Rodriguez keyed his comm. "All stations, Third-Three. We have a body in Maintenance Section Seven-Delta. Appears to be... murder. I need Lieutenant Tanaka down here now."

Tanaka arrived six minutes later, her mind already working through the implications. A murder. On a research station. With a data drive and comm terminals.

This wasn't random violence. This was operational security.

## Tanaka's Investigation Begins

Tanaka secured the scene while Rodriguez and Park maintained perimeter. She photographed the body, the drive, the terminals. Everything methodical, professional.

"Time of death?" she asked the medical technician who arrived moments later.

"Preliminary estimate: thirty to forty-five minutes ago. Single trauma to the head, impact with the deck edge there." He pointed. "Looks like she fell backward during a struggle."

Tanaka examined the data drive still clutched in Miller's hand. Standard research storage, encrypted. The kind researchers used to transport data between labs.

But Miller was support staff. No research clearance. No reason to have this.

The communication terminals behind the body showed recent access. Tanaka pulled the logs: someone had used these terminals two hours ago to access the station's communication array. Encrypted transmissions sent to external relays.

Not standard procedure. Not authorized channels.

She photographed everything, then began building suspect lists. Who had access to this section? Who wasn't at their duty station during the estimated time of death?

The comm logs gave her a starting point. Five people had keycards registering in this area within the last three hours who weren't assigned here:
1. Dr. Marcus Webb - Research scientist, xenobiology
2. Tech Specialist James Parker - Communications maintenance
3. Dr. Lisa Kwan - Xenobiology researcher
4. Legionary Davis - Off-duty, no assigned location
5. Support Tech David Park - Logistics, unscheduled movement

Five suspects. One dead technician. One encrypted drive. And unauthorized transmissions sent from this very room.

Tanaka secured the drive—she'd need to crack the encryption to see what Miller died for. She locked down the communication logs for analysis.

Then she started with the transmissions themselves.

## The First Breakthrough

Two hours into her investigation, working at her security office terminal while coordinating with the medical examiner, Tanaka found something.

The unauthorized transmissions had been hidden in routine scientific telemetry—piggyback signals that wouldn't show up on standard monitoring. Someone knew exactly how to mask their traffic.

Most of the messages were heavily encrypted, unbreakable without days of processing time. But one transmission from three weeks ago contained stellar coordinates in standard navigational format—the kind used fleet-wide for jump calculations.

Her decryption software recognized the pattern instantly. Standard astronomical notation, no encryption beyond the basic message wrapper.

She cracked it in twenty minutes.

The transmission contained: Obsidian Station's precise coordinates. The weekly supply schedule. Station population. Research focus areas.

Sent to an external relay, then bounced through multiple commercial messaging stations until the origin trail went cold.

Someone had told someone else exactly where to find Obsidian Station, when supply ships arrived, and what kind of research happened here.

Tanaka's blood went cold.

She pulled up current supply schedules. Commander Varro's task force was due to arrive today. The schedule had been transmitted three weeks ago.

If someone wanted to attack the station when a supply ship arrived...

Before she could finish the thought, proximity alarms screamed throughout Obsidian.

Krell ships. Dropping out of jump.

The attack wasn't a coincidence. Someone had given them this station's location. Someone had told them when to strike.

And Tanaka had five suspects, one dead accomplice, and no time to investigate further.

## The Assault

The Krell don't negotiate. Plasma lances cut through Obsidian's defensive grid in minutes. Some researchers make it to escape pods—the physics team, several junior scientists, a few technicians. Eighteen pods launch immediately with whatever data they grabbed, fleeing before Krell boarding pods hit the station.

The escape pod bay is in the outer ring. The Krell breach there first, cutting off that avenue of escape. The remaining personnel—142 researchers and staff, and all eighty legionaries—fall back toward the central hangar bays.

Twenty-eight civilians die in the fighting retreat. Krell shock troops sweep through corridors. Cybernetically enhanced, pain-immune, relentless. They're hunting something specific.

One hundred seventy personnel reach the hangar bays alive. The Krell are minutes behind.

Tanaka grabs the encrypted drive from her security office, along with her investigation files. If they survive this, she'll need that evidence.

## Chen's Century Holds the Line

Centurion Chen—promoted from the ranks three years ago after fifteen years as an enlisted legionary—commands Obsidian's garrison: a single century of eighty legionaries, organized into ten contubernia of eight soldiers each. Not enough to hold a station under determined assault, but enough to buy time.

Chen's grandfather served in the First Generation, one of the founding legionaries who established the Confederation military 150 years ago. The gladius at Chen's hip—molecular-edge blade in a ceremonial sheath—belonged to his grandfather. The weight of that tradition sits heavy on his shoulders today.

"First through Fifth Contubernia, fall back to Corridor Junction Seven," Chen orders over the tactical net. "Sixth through Tenth, establish firing positions at Junction Nine. We're buying time for the civilians to reach the hangars. Standard delaying action—contact, suppress, withdraw. Nobody plays hero."

His optio, Sergeant Kowalski—a veteran with eighteen years service who could have taken centurion rank but prefers the tactical work—acknowledges. "Understood, Centurion. How long do we hold?"

"Until everyone's evacuated or we're dead. Whichever comes first."

Chen moves to Junction Seven with his own contubernium—eight legionaries he's lived, trained, and fought with for the past two years. Decanus Rodriguez leads them in Chen's absence, but today Chen fights alongside them. These seven are his brothers and sisters: Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Thompson, Davis, Kim, and Okonkwo.

"Contact in thirty seconds," Rodriguez reports, checking his rifle. "Krell shock troops, heavy armor."

The legionaries take positions with practiced efficiency. This is what months of daily drills create—automatic response, muscle memory, professional execution. Thompson and Kim, both qualified in basic engineering like every legionary, quickly weld reinforcement plates to cover positions and rig improvised charges in the approach corridor. It takes them ninety seconds.

"Fortifications complete," Thompson reports. "We're dug in."

The Krell arrive—twelve cybernetically enhanced shock troops in powered armor. Chen's contubernium opens fire from prepared positions. Kinetic rounds spark off Krell armor. The enemy advances steadily, absorbing damage that would kill organic soldiers.

"Suppress and withdraw," Chen orders. Thompson triggers the improvised charges, collapsing part of the corridor. It won't stop the Krell, but it slows them.

The contubernium falls back in disciplined stages—four legionaries firing while four displace, then switching. Professional execution. Nobody panics. Nobody breaks.

They reach Junction Nine, where Kowalski's contubernia have established a second defensive line. The two units integrate seamlessly, overlapping fields of fire, supporting each other's movements.

"Civilians are in the hangar bays," Tanaka reports over comms. "But the Krell are breaching from multiple directions. We're getting boxed in."

Chen checks his tactical display. They've exhausted half their kinetic ammunition. The Krell are pushing from three corridors simultaneously. And his century is down to seventy effectives after the running firefight.

Ten legionaries dead. The mathematics are brutal. They can't win this fight conventionally.

## The Desperate Gambit

Chen and twelve legionaries—his contubernium plus four others—hold the final chokepoint: a narrow maintenance corridor connecting the research wing to the hangar bays. They've nearly exhausted kinetic ammunition. Krell advance in powered armor, servos hissing, optical sensors glowing red.

A Krell takes three shots to the chest and keeps coming. Chen's legionaries fix bayonets—gladius blades, molecular-edge weapons carried by every legionary as both symbol and tool. Good for close quarters but suicidal against armored cyborgs at range.

Dr. Adeyemi, trapped with them, makes a desperate decision. He has six prototype phase-variance generators meant for testing. And he has the mysterious object—he grabbed it when evacuating his lab. "I don't know if these will work on living tissue," he admits, distributing the generators to Chen's volunteers.

Chen understands instantly. "Activate on my mark. We can't fight while phased—weapons won't work. So we position ourselves, then power down, engage, and move. Use the gladius—get close."

He selects six legionaries from those present—Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Thompson, Davis, and Okonkwo from his own contubernium, plus himself. The other five will hold the corridor conventionally.

The six volunteers wrap the generators onto their armor. Chen checks his gladius—his grandfather's blade, carried by a First Generation legionary 150 years ago. The molecular edge activates with a faint hum.

This is what Virtus means, Chen thinks. Excellence in the face of impossible odds. Doing your duty even when it costs everything. His grandfather would understand.

"Mark."

## The First Shield Combat

The generators activate. The seven legionaries vanish—not invisible, but gone from normal space. The Krell's sensors lose target lock. Their infrared can't see the legionaries. Their audio sensors hear nothing.

The Krell pause, confused, weapons sweeping empty corridors.

Chen feels it immediately—a profound disorientation, like his inner ear has been removed. The world looks strange, colors shifted, perspectives wrong. He's trained for zero-g, for high-g, for every combat environment—but nothing prepared him for this. His stomach lurches.

Rodriguez stumbles, fighting nausea. Davis goes to one knee, breathing hard. But they're legionaries. They fight through it.

Chen uses hand signals—visible to phased personnel: Rally. Form up. We have ninety seconds.

By fifteen seconds, Chen is functional despite the wrongness. By twenty seconds, Rodriguez and Martinez have recovered. Davis takes thirty seconds, but she gives the thumbs-up. They're professionals. They'll do their jobs.

They move forward, walking through the Krell formation. The sensation is nauseating—passing through solid matter feels like walking through thick syrup that doesn't exist. Intellectually Chen knows he's phased, but his brain screams that this is wrong.

They position themselves throughout the Krell formation. Eight Krell, seven legionaries. Chen uses hand signals visible only to his phased team: Ready positions. Target assignments. On my mark.

At forty seconds remaining: Ready.

At thirty seconds: Stand by.

At fifteen seconds: Now.

Seven generators shut down simultaneously. Seven legionaries materialize among the Krell—inside their formation, at point-blank range.

The Krell spin, but it's too late. Chen drives his grandfather's gladius into the joint between helmet and armor collar—the only vulnerable point. The molecular edge cuts through like the material isn't there. The Krell drops, cybernetics severing.

His contubernium attacks with brutal efficiency. Close quarters. No room for the Krell's plasma rifles—too bulky, too slow. The gladius blades are perfect for this—short, quick, devastating.

Rodriguez vomits inside his helmet—the phase disorientation catching up—but still manages to drive his blade through a Krell's knee joint. Park staggers, head spinning, but recovers in time to parry a Krell's desperate strike.

Davis, still green from phase-shock, provides covering fire while Thompson and Okonkwo close to melee range. Okonkwo's gladius finds the gap in a Krell's armor, her strike precise despite the disorientation.

It's not a fight. It's a slaughter. Eight Krell in sixteen seconds.

Chen breathes hard, fighting his own nausea. "Report."

"Three wounded—nothing serious," Kowalski reports over comms, having witnessed the action from the defensive line. "Rodriguez puked in his helmet. Martinez can't stand straight. Davis looks like he's going to pass out."

"Get them to the hangar. We bought enough time."

As his contubernium moves out, Chen takes one last look at his gladius. His grandfather carried this blade in the founding battles of the Confederation. Today, it drew blood in a new kind of warfare.

The tradition continues.

## The Unexpected Arrival

Commander Varro's task force drops out of jump at the system edge—not in close orbit, because calculations near a planet's gravity well require precision they don't have time for on this leg of the evaluation.

The cruiser Resolute and two frigates are running a systematic test of the Confederation's newly-acquired jump drive technology. Varro's mission: evaluate jump performance over extended distances, document any anomalies, and deliver requested equipment to frontier stations along the route.

Commander Sarah Varro had served fifteen years in the Confederation military—eight as an enlisted legionary before earning her commission and citizenship through military service. She'd risen through merit, from the front lines to command, carrying the lessons of ground combat into fleet operations. Today's evaluation mission was routine. Technical. Safe.

The fabricators in Resolute's cargo bay were specifically requested by Dr. Adeyemi three weeks ago—advanced manufacturing equipment for prototype development. Supply schedules are routine, predictable, logged.

"Emergence successful," her navigation officer reports. "Jump accuracy within acceptable parameters. We're 3 light-minutes from Obsidian Station."

Varro nods, making notes for her evaluation report. "How's the jump drive holding up, Torres?"

Chief Engineer Torres checks her readouts. "Cells are nominal. No degradation from the long jump. I'd say—" She stops. "Ma'am, I'm reading weapons fire in Obsidian orbit."

"What?"

The sensor officer's hands fly across his console. "Confirming. Krell strike force in close orbit around Obsidian. Three heavy cruisers, two destroyer escorts. The station's defensive grid is down. I'm reading... escape pods. Eighteen of them, already clear of the engagement zone."

Varro's mind races. Jump drive evaluation mission. Fabricators in the hold. Predictable supply schedule.

They knew we were coming.

"Battle stations. Retrieve those escape pods. Torres, can we jump in closer?"

Chief Engineer Torres shakes her head. "Not safely, ma'am. We'd need two hours to recalculate for that planet's gravity well. And we don't have current gravitational data for the inner system—we'd be jumping blind."

"Then we go in on drives. Full acceleration. Weapons, spin up. And get me those pods."

The frigates deploy to collect the escape pods while Resolute burns toward Obsidian. At full military acceleration, they'll reach orbital insertion in thirty-eight minutes.

Too long. But it's all they have.

## The Conference Call

When Resolute's frigates recover the eighteen escape pods, they find terrified researchers and a treasure trove: the physics team evacuated with partial data on Adeyemi's phase-shield breakthrough. Not complete—the transmission was cut short—but enough to understand the basic principles.

Varro immediately establishes a conference link with Obsidian Station. The video feed shows chaos: smoke, emergency lighting, the unmistakable sound of weapons fire in the background.

On screen: Dr. Adeyemi (physics lead), Centurion Chen (military commander), Lieutenant Tanaka (intelligence officer). From Resolute: Varro, Torres, and six shuttle pilots. Five of the six pilots are women—shuttle pilots tend to be predominantly female for whatever reason.

"Status?" Varro demands.

Chen's face is grim. "One hundred seventy personnel alive in the hangar bays. We've lost ten legionaries holding the approach corridors. Civilians took twenty-eight casualties reaching this position. The Krell are breaching from three directions. We have maybe fifteen minutes before they reach us."

"Can you hold longer?"

"No, ma'am. We're nearly out of ammunition. It's going to be gladius work soon, and we can't hold against their numbers in melee."

Adeyemi interjects: "Commander, did the escape pods make it?"

"We have them. Your physics team brought partial data on the phase-shields."

"Partial?" Adeyemi's expression shows relief mixed with concern. "How much?"

Torres responds from Resolute: "Enough to understand the theory. Field generation principles, emitter specifications, power requirements. But the fabrication process is incomplete. We're missing critical assembly details."

"I can talk you through it," Adeyemi says. "But it'll take time we don't have."

Varro does the math in her head. "We'll reach orbit in thirty-eight minutes. Our shuttles can hold thirty personnel each, we have six. That's one hundred eighty capacity total—enough for everyone if we can land and extract."

One of the shuttle pilots—Lieutenant Tessa Morrison, veteran of a dozen combat insertions—speaks up. "Ma'am, the Krell blockade will tear apart loaded shuttles on conventional approach. We need a way through that perimeter."

Silence. Everyone's thinking the same thing.

Torres says it first: "The phase-shields."

All eyes turn to her.

"We have partial data from the escape pods. We have Dr. Adeyemi on comm who can fill the gaps. And we have the advanced fabricators in our cargo bay—the ones you requested," she nods at Adeyemi through the video feed.

Adeyemi leans forward. "You're proposing building shield generators? On Resolute?"

"For the shuttles," Torres confirms. "Shield them on approach, phase through the Krell blockade, land in your hangar. Load everyone. Shield again on departure."

"Can you do it?" Varro asks.

Torres runs calculations in her head. "Building a basic training-drone sized shield? Straightforward if I have the specs. Scaling to shuttle-size? That's educated guesswork."

"Walk me through the problems," Varro says.

"Power, primarily," Torres replies. "Shuttle power cells won't provide enough juice for a shuttle-sized phase field. I'd need something with much higher discharge capacity."

One of the rescued physicists, listening from the recovered escape pods, speaks up: "What about weapon capacitors? They're rated for massive energy discharge."

Torres considers. "That... could work. Strip the capacitors from the shuttles, reroute them to power the shield emitters. But we'd lose all offensive capability on those shuttles."

"How many could you build?" Varro presses.

"With the fabricators and the time we have?" Torres calculates. "Two. Maybe. If Dr. Adeyemi can talk me through the assembly process and nothing goes wrong."

"Two generators," Varro says. "Two shuttles, shielded. Sixty-two people each if we cram them."

"One hundred twenty-four total," Chen confirms. "We have one hundred seventy here. That leaves—"

"Forty-six," Morrison finishes. "Four unshielded shuttles can carry them if we load external hardpoints."

"External hardpoints in a combat extraction?" Another pilot looks skeptical. "That's insane."

Morrison shrugs. "We volunteered for this job, Ramirez. Volunteers first. Sane is maybe third on the list."

The other five shuttle pilots exchange glances. Then, one by one, they nod.

"We're in," Ramirez says. "All six of us."

Varro looks at her pilots. These are evaluation mission pilots—test duty, not combat. They signed up to gather data on jump drives, not run blockades.

But they're volunteers. The Confederation military is all volunteer. That means something.

"All right," Varro decides. "Torres, build me two shield generators. Two shuttles carry civilians only, shielded on approach and departure. Four shuttles go in weapons-hot, provide cover, carry the rest."

"Understood, ma'am," Torres says. "But I need to be clear about the uncertainty. I'm jury-rigging power integration, scaling emitters beyond tested parameters, and working from incomplete schematics. Simulations will be inconclusive at best."

"What's your best estimate on shield duration?"

Torres grimaces. "Somewhere between five and twenty-five minutes per charge. That's a hell of a variance, but I can't narrow it down without more data."

"Five minutes minimum?"

"Should be."

"That's enough. Do it."

Torres nods. "Fair warning: the AI models for this work are computationally expensive. Pattern recognition, scaling algorithms—it'll consume significant ship processing capacity while I'm building and testing."

"How much?"

"Maybe thirty to forty percent of available infrastructure. Navigation and life support are isolated, but general networks will see performance degradation."

Varro considers. "We're stuck here for thirty-eight minutes anyway. Make it work."

Torres cuts the feed, already moving.

Adeyemi speaks up from Obsidian: "Commander, one more thing. We don't know how the phase effect will feel for untrained personnel. My prototypes were only tested on objects and then on Centurion Chen's legionaries in combat. The psychological effects were... severe. Disorientation, nausea, visual distortion."

Chen confirms: "Some of my people couldn't function for thirty seconds. And we're trained for extreme environments. Civilians packed into a shuttle?"

"It's going to be bad," Adeyemi finishes. "They need to know."

Varro looks at Morrison. "Can your pilots handle it?"

"We'll find out, ma'am," Morrison says. Then, with a slight smile: "Like I said. Volunteers first."

## Torres's Engineering Sprint

Torres and her engineering team work with controlled urgency. Thirty-eight minutes until orbital insertion. Every second counts.

She has advantages: the advanced fabricators Adeyemi requested are designed for precision prototype work. The partial data from the escape pods includes emitter specifications and field generation mathematics. And Adeyemi is on open comm, talking her through the theoretical challenges in real-time.

But she's scaling a training-drone shield to shuttle-size with no testing and no margin for error.

"First problem: emitter arrays," Torres dictates to her team. "Dr. Adeyemi's specs call for forty-centimeter arrays for drone-scale. We need two-meter arrays for shuttle coverage. Fabricate them at exact specifications but scale the dimensions by a factor of five."

The fabricators hum to life. Precise, fast, expensive—and exactly what they need.

While the emitters build, Torres tackles power integration.

"Strip weapon capacitors from Shuttles Two and Five," she orders. "I need full banks, all safeties bypassed."

"Ma'am, without safeties, if anything arcs—"

"I know the risks. Do it."

The capacitors come out: massive cylinders designed to charge plasma weapons. Each one can discharge enough energy to vaporize a small building. Torres needs to connect them to phase-shield emitters designed for steady-state power draw.

She fabricates custom adapters, routing the capacitor discharge through voltage regulators and harmonic dampeners. It's more improvisation than engineering. More duct tape than design.

"Dr. Adeyemi," she calls over the comm. "I'm getting harmonic interference in the power coupling. The capacitors are rated for pulse discharge, but the shields need sustained load. The frequency mismatch is creating feedback."

From Obsidian, Adeyemi's voice crackles back: "You need to smooth the discharge curve. Try adding a resonance buffer—something that can absorb the pulse spikes and release steady power."

"I don't have resonance buffers."

"What do you have?"

Torres scans her inventory. "Jump drive harmonic regulators."

Pause. "Those operate at completely different frequencies."

"But the principle is the same, right? Absorb variable input, release stable output."

"Theoretically... yes. But you'd need to recalibrate them. The phase-shield frequency is nowhere near jump drive harmonics."

"Can you give me the calibration math?"

Another pause. Torres can almost hear Adeyemi thinking. "It's going to be unstable. The regulators aren't designed for this."

"Unstable is better than non-functional."

"All right. Here's what you do..."

For the next twenty minutes, Torres and Adeyemi work through the integration. Fabricate scaled emitter arrays. Route weapon capacitors through recalibrated jump drive regulators. Mount emitters to shuttle external hardpoints. Wire everything through bypassed safety interlocks that scream warnings with every connection.

Behind Torres, one of her engineers mutters about sluggish terminals. The AI models running fabrication optimizations and scaling algorithms are already consuming processing capacity, slowing down general networks.

The first generator test: shield activates, flickers, dies after forty seconds.

"Emitter three is overheating," Torres reports. "Power draw is uneven across the array."

"Reduce input by fifteen percent and inverse the polarity on the secondary coils," Adeyemi suggests.

Torres makes the adjustment. Second test: shield activates, holds steady. Duration estimate from her instruments: wildly variable. Five minutes. Ten. Twenty-five. The readings fluctuate.

"I can't narrow the variance," Torres admits. "Too many improvised components, too much uncertainty in the scaling."

"Can you guarantee five minutes?" Varro asks from the bridge.

Torres looks at her readings. "I can guarantee it should work. Five to twenty-five minutes is my professional best guess."

"That'll have to do. How many generators?"

"Two functional. I'm building a third as backup, but we're at thirty-two minutes. We'll be cutting it close."

"Build fast, Chief."

At thirty-five minutes, Torres has two generators installed on Shuttles Two and Five. Weapon capacitors powering jury-rigged emitter arrays through recalibrated jump drive regulators. The shuttles are unarmed—every weapon capacitor stripped for shield power.

No weapons. No guarantees. Just professional expertise and improvisation.

The shuttles launch at thirty-seven minutes. Six shuttles, two shielded, all carrying the hope of one hundred seventy people.

## The Insertion

Six shuttles burn toward Obsidian Station in tight formation. Shuttle Two and Five—the shielded ones—fly in the center. The four unshielded shuttles form a protective box around them.

The Krell blockade notices. Three assault shuttles detach from the station, moving to intercept.

"Weapons free," Morrison orders over the tactical net. "Light them up."

The four armed shuttles open fire. Plasma bolts and kinetic rounds streak across the void. The Krell assault shuttles return fire, but they're focused on the Confederation formation—not realizing what's hidden in the center.

"Civilian shuttles, stay tight," Morrison commands. "We'll clear the path."

The formation drives through the Krell picket. One Krell assault shuttle breaks apart under concentrated fire. The other two peel off, damaged, regrouping.

But in the chaos, Shuttle Five takes a glancing hit. External damage, port side. The shield emitter mount cracks—not catastrophically, but enough. Warning lights don't trigger; the damage is external, and the systems can't see it yet.

The formation reaches Obsidian's hangar bay. All six shuttles land in sequence, combat-fast. Hatches open before the landing struts fully compress.

"Go! Go! Go!" Chen's voice over external speakers. "Civilians to Shuttles Two and Five! Legionaries, load on the others!"

## The Loading Chaos

The hangar is a war zone. Smoke, emergency lights, the distant sound of Krell breaching through corridors. Chen's remaining legionaries—now down to fifty-five after fifteen more died in the fighting retreat to the hangar—hold defensive positions at the three entry points.

Civilians rush for the two designated shuttles. One hundred twenty-four people, panicked, some wounded. They pack in like cargo: standing room only, sitting on laps, pressed against bulkheads.

Four civilians don't make it. One takes a Krell plasma bolt through the chest—long-range fire from a breaching team. Two more die in the crush, trampled or suffocated. A fourth has a heart attack from stress and fear, dies before medics can respond.

One hundred twenty civilians board successfully. Sixty on each shielded shuttle.

The legionaries fall back in stages, covering each other. They carry seventeen bodies—fallen brothers they refuse to leave behind. Roman tradition: the dead come home.

"Last squad, fall back!" Chen orders. His contubernium—Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Davis, Kim, Okonkwo, and Thompson—provides covering fire from the hangar entrance while the others board.

Fifty-five legionaries pack into the four unshielded shuttles. Some ride internal compartments, others cling to external hardpoints—exposed, vulnerable, trusting their pilots and their brothers.

Chen does a final count. Everyone's accounted for except—

"Centurion." Thompson steps forward. "Someone needs to rig the reactor. Deny the Krell everything."

Chen's stomach tightens. He knows Thompson is right. Leaving the station intact means the Krell get intelligence, research data, everything Adeyemi discovered.

But Thompson is part of his contubernium. His brother.

"Kowalski can—"

"No, sir." Thompson is calm, certain. "You need Kowalski for tactical command. You need to get back and teach them how the shields work in combat. I'm a combat engineer. I know explosives. And..." he pauses. "I'm the logical choice."

Chen wants to argue. Wants to order someone else. But Thompson is right, and they both know it.

This isn't about glory. It's about duty. About making sure his brothers—his century, his people—have the best chance to survive and to win.

"How long?" Chen asks quietly.

"I'll hold the reactor level as long as I can. When they breach, I'll blow it. They'll get nothing."

Chen grips Thompson's shoulder. No speeches. No drama. Just two professionals who understand what needs to happen.

"Your family will know," Chen says. "They'll know you did your duty."

"Thank you, sir." Thompson nods to his contubernium—Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Davis, Kim, Okonkwo. His brothers. "Take care of each other."

Then he turns and runs toward the reactor level.

Chen boards the last shuttle. His chest feels tight. Thompson's absence is already a wound.

But there's no time. The shuttles lift, engines screaming.

## The Phase Run

Morrison briefs her passengers hastily over the internal comm. "We're activating an experimental shield in ten seconds. Nobody knows exactly what it feels like. You'll experience severe disorientation, maybe nausea. Stay strapped in. Hold onto something. Don't panic."

She doesn't mention that she doesn't know what it feels like either. That she's about to find out if she's phase-tolerant or not.

"Shield activating in three... two... one... mark."

The generator engages. Reality shifts.

She feels it hit like a hammer—her inner ear screaming wrongness, her vision distorting, colors bleeding into frequencies that don't exist. Her stomach lurches. For two seconds, she's sure she's going to vomit.

Then her brain adapts. Not fully—everything still feels wrong—but functionally. She can see the controls. She can move her hands.

She's phase-tolerant. She didn't know. But thank God she is.

Behind her, the civilian passengers aren't so lucky. Screaming. Vomiting. Someone's crying, begging it to stop. But they're strapped in, and they're holding on.

She checks her chrono. Five to twenty-five minutes. Somewhere in there.

She guns the engines.

On Shuttle Five, the pilot isn't phase-tolerant.

He feels the shift and immediately loses all sense of orientation. The controls blur. His hands spasm. The shuttle yaws hard to starboard, spinning.

"I can't—I can't see—"

His copilot, Lieutenant Sara Chen, strapped in beside him, fights through her own disorientation. She's phase-tolerant, but it still takes fifteen seconds to function. Fifteen seconds where the shuttle tumbles, passengers screaming, the pilot's hands frozen on useless controls.

"Move!" She unbuckles, staggers forward, shoves the pilot aside. Her hands find the controls. The shuttle is spinning, engines firing at random vectors.

Twenty seconds to stabilize. The passengers are thrown against bulkheads, some breaking bones, all terrified.

But she gets it. The shuttle straightens. She checks Morrison's trajectory and matches it.

"Straight through the station," Morrison's voice over tactical comm. "Shortest path."

Lieutenant Chen acknowledges and follows.

Both shuttles accelerate directly into Obsidian's hull. The sensation of phasing through solid matter—through decks and bulkheads and equipment—is indescribable. Psychological horror. Every instinct screaming that this is impossible, that they're dying, that reality is broken.

Civilians are screaming, some passing out, others clawing at their restraints.

Then they're through. Open space on the far side.

Both pilots slam their throttles to maximum. Twelve-g burn toward Resolute.

The standing passengers collapse. Bones break under the acceleration. But they're alive, and they're moving.

## The Diversion

The four unshielded shuttles launch in tight formation, weapons hot.

Their mission: make the Krell think all six shuttles are escaping conventionally. The two phased shuttles are invisible—the Krell can't see them.

Eight Krell assault shuttles are already launching from the station, converging on the Confederation formation.

"Engage at will," Morrison orders over tactical comm. "Make them focus on us."

The four armed shuttles open fire, spreading out, creating multiple targets. The legionaries riding external hardpoints add their rifles to the barrage—insane, exposed, but providing additional fire.

The Krell take the bait. They see four shuttles shooting at them. They don't see the two phased shuttles burning hard on a different vector.

The running battle is vicious.

Shuttle Three takes a direct hit—plasma lance through the engine compartment. The shuttle disintegrates in a flash of superheated metal. Fourteen legionaries aboard. Dead instantly. Three bodies they were carrying, lost.

Shuttles One and Six suffer battle damage. Hull breaches, venting atmosphere. The pilots emergency-seal cockpits. Legionaries in the rear compartments—some die from decompression, others cling to consciousness in their suits.

Shuttle Four, relatively intact, covers the damaged shuttles, its weapons blazing.

Frigate One burns in to help, its point defense engaging the Krell assault shuttles. The frigate is outmatched—one ship versus eight—but it buys seconds, creates openings.

Three damaged Confederation shuttles fight their way toward Resolute, Krell on their tails.

## The Civilian Shuttles

Morrison's shuttle—Shuttle Two—runs clean. The shield holds steady. Her instruments show twelve minutes elapsed, shield still active. They got lucky on the duration variance.

She pushes the shuttle hard, twelve-g burn, and crosses into Resolute's defensive perimeter with the shield still holding.

"Resolute, Shuttle Two. We're coming in hot. Shield is still active."

"Acknowledged, Two. Hangar bay is clear."

Morrison threads through Resolute's hangar bay entrance, kills her velocity in a brutal deceleration that throws her passengers forward against their restraints. More injuries. But they're down.

The shield drops just as her landing struts touch the deck.

"We're in! Medical to Hangar Bay One, mass casualties!"

Shuttle Five isn't as lucky.

Lieutenant Chen, still fighting through phase disorientation, pushes toward Resolute. Eight minutes elapsed. Ten. Twelve.

At thirteen minutes, the shield flickers.

The damaged emitter mount—cracked during the insertion—finally fails. Power fluctuations cascade through the jury-rigged system. The shield phases in and out, unstable.

"I'm losing it!" Chen reports. "Shield's failing!"

Torres, monitoring from engineering, sees the telemetry. "Shuttle Five, you're not going to make it on the shield. Recommend conventional approach, we'll cover you."

"Understood."

The shield dies completely. Shuttle Five materializes mid-flight, half the distance to Resolute.

Immediately, Krell sensors lock on. Plasma lances reach out.

"Helm, intercept course!" Varro orders from Resolute's bridge. "Point defense, stand by!"

Resolute, massive and unarmed—her weapon capacitors stripped for the shields—burns toward the vulnerable shuttle. The cruiser's point defense systems are still functional, and they open up, intercepting Krell fire.

Frigate Two moves to suppress the Krell cruisers, buying seconds with concentrated fire. The frigate takes hits—armor breaches, casualties mounting—but holds position.

Shuttle Five crosses into Resolute's hangar with Krell plasma lances hitting all around. The shuttle's half-phased when the shield failed, and the violent re-materialization damaged the hull. It crashes onto the hangar deck, skids, slams into a bulkhead.

The pilot and Lieutenant Chen survive. Thirty-two passengers are injured in the crash, but alive.

Resolute's armor is scarred from the covering fire. Frigate Two is heavily damaged, trailing atmosphere, but still functional.

All civilians are aboard.

## The Station's End

On Obsidian Station, Thompson reaches the reactor level. Fifteen Krell shock troops are breaching from two directions.

He's rigged the entire reactor with every explosive charge the legionaries had left. Enough to turn the station into vapor.

He holds the access corridor alone. Gladius in one hand, rifle in the other. He kills three Krell before his ammunition runs out.

Then it's just the gladius. Molecular edge against powered armor. He's good—combat engineer training includes close-quarters—but he's one man against cybernetically-enhanced killers.

He holds for ninety seconds. Takes down two more Krell. But a plasma bolt catches him in the leg, and he goes down.

The Krell advance. Ten seconds from the reactor.

Thompson, bleeding, triggers the detonation.

The reactor doesn't just explode—it vaporizes. Obsidian Station becomes a brief sun, consuming everything. The Krell troops inside. All the research data. The laboratories. Everything.

The Krell got nothing.

## The Krell Response

Up until the station explodes, the Krell were calculating acceptable losses. Their primary objective was capturing the research station intact. Shuttles escaping with personnel was annoying but acceptable.

Then Obsidian Station becomes an expanding cloud of plasma and debris.

Their objective: completely denied.

Their troops on the station: dead.

The intelligence value: zero.

The Krell's tactical calculus shifts instantly. Objective failed. The enemy must pay.

All three Krell heavy cruisers and both destroyer escorts disengage from the station's orbit. They turn on Varro's task force with full weapons.

"All Krell ships are pursuing," Resolute's sensor officer reports. "They're closing fast. Weapons hot."

Varro sees the tactical display. Three Krell heavy cruisers plus two destroyers versus her unarmed cruiser and two frigates—one of them heavily damaged.

The Confederation position is impossible.

"Shuttle status?" Varro demands.

"All three surviving military shuttles are docked. Casualties are high, but we have them."

"Torres, jump status?"

"Ma'am, we need ninety minutes for safe jump calculations—"

"We don't have ninety minutes. We have maybe five before those Krell cruisers are in weapons range."

Torres understands immediately. "Emergency jump. Understood. Plotting best-guess course toward Confederation space now."

"How bad will it be?"

"We'll destroy the jump cells. We'll emerge... somewhere. And we'll be stranded until we can fabricate new cells and map our position."

"Better stranded than dead. Do it."

## The Emergency Jump

"All personnel, brace for emergency jump," Varro announces over ship-wide comm. "This will be rough."

Torres feeds the cells energy far beyond their design specifications. The jump drive mathematics compress space, folding reality around Resolute and her two frigates.

"Jump in three... two... one... jump!"

Space twists. The task force vanishes.

The Krell weapons fire hits empty void where they were.

Resolute and her frigates emerge in deep interstellar space. No nearby stars. No familiar reference points. The sensor displays show nothing but darkness.

"Jump cells destroyed," Torres reports. "Multiple systems offline from the overload. We're stranded until I can build new cells."

"Casualties?"

"Still assessing. The jump was rough. We have injuries from the acceleration and some equipment failures. But we're alive."

Varro nods. "How long to get us home?"

"Three days to fabricate new jump cells. One day to gather gravitational data and calculate a safe jump home. Four days total."

"Then we have four days to figure out what we've learned."

## Aftermath: The Cost

The tally comes in over the next hour as medical teams triage and damage control teams assess.

Civilians:
- Started with 170 on Obsidian (after 18 escaped in pods, 28 died reaching hangar)
- 4 died during loading
- 4 died from injuries during high-g extraction
- 120 survived

Legionaries:
- Started with 80
- 10 killed in initial fighting
- 15 killed in fighting retreat to hangar
- 14 killed when Shuttle Three was destroyed
- 1 stayed behind (Thompson)
- 6 died from decompression injuries on damaged shuttles
- 34 survived

Frigate Two:
- 23 crew killed, 47 wounded

Shuttle crews:
- 8 killed with Shuttle Three
- 12 wounded across other shuttles

Total casualties: 81 dead, 139 wounded.

Total survivors: 154 from Obsidian, plus Resolute's crew and frigate crews.

The price of victory.

Tanaka secures the encrypted drive from Miller's body in her quarters. The investigation will continue. But first, they need to survive.

## Day One: Recovery and Assessment

Resolute settles into emergency protocols. Medical teams work around the clock. Engineers assess damage. Everyone not critical to ship operations pitches in—legionaries helping in medical, researchers assisting damage control.

The ship's networks run sluggishly. Entertainment systems buffer. Personal terminals lag.

In medical bay, Chen waits while a technician scans his injuries. The terminal freezes mid-scan.

"Sorry, sir," the technician says. "Network's been sluggish since we jumped. Something's eating up processing capacity." She taps the screen. "There we go. Resuming scan."

Chen doesn't mention he'd heard something about forensic work being done. Not his concern.

In engineering, one of Torres's team complains: "Chief, damage assessment models are taking forever. Hull stress analysis that should take ten minutes is pushing forty."

Torres glances at her workstation. She's about to start something computationally expensive.

"Known issue," she says. "Priority tasking will be consuming compute resources. Run your analysis, it'll just take longer."

"What priority tasking?"

"Classified investigation. Commander's orders. Deal with the slowdown."

## Day One: The Data Drive Problem

Tanaka works on the encrypted drive while the ship recovers from the emergency jump. Standard research drive encryption. Twenty-four-hour credential timer running from when Miller died.

She's making slow progress when the drive wipes itself. Twenty-four hours expired, no credentials entered.

Tanaka gets some data before the complete wipe—partial files, fragments—but the majority is lost.

She sits back, frustrated. All that evidence, gone.

"Damn it!" She doesn't realize she said it aloud until Torres appears in her doorway.

"Problem?" The chief engineer has a coffee in hand.

"The drive wiped itself. Standard research security—software-level wipe after credential timeout. I got some files before it triggered, but the majority is gone."

"Wait." Torres sets down her coffee, interested now. "Was it classified storage?"

"No. Standard research drive. Why does that matter?"

Torres pulls up a chair. "Classified drives physically destroy the memory cores when they wipe—thermal charges, magnetic scrambling. But standard drives? They just scramble the access software and filesystem. The actual data is still there—electrons locked in specific quantum states across the physical media."

Tanaka looks at the drive. "You can read it?"

"The physical cores? Yes. That's just scanning electron matrices—government labs do it all the time for forensics. Requires precision equipment, but I can build that." Torres pauses. "Reading is the easy part. Making sense of what we read? That's harder."

"What do you mean?"

"When we read the cores, we get raw binary data. Just electrons in patterns. No file structure, no organization, no labels. It's like having all the words from a book but scrambled randomly—you need to figure out which words go together to form sentences, which sentences form paragraphs."

"How long?"

"To build the reader? Six hours. To scan the cores? Maybe thirty minutes. To reconstruct the actual files?" Torres grimaces. "That's where it gets complicated. We'll need AI models to analyze which sections of the physical media were accessed when—works in reverse chronological order, so most recent files emerge first. Then more AI to reassemble the data blocks into recognizable formats."

"How long for that?"

"Minutes per file for common formats—text, images, standard video. Could be hours or days for proprietary formats. And to fully decode the entire drive? Weeks, maybe months. You'd need proper forensic systems back at Intelligence."

Tanaka considers. "But we'd get the most recent files first?"

"Yes. Whatever was accessed or modified last comes out fastest. Oldest data takes longest to reconstruct." Torres pauses. "Fair warning: the AI models are computationally expensive. Pattern recognition across terabytes of binary data, running multiple reconstruction algorithms in parallel—it'll eat up significant ship processing capacity."

"How much?"

"While it's running? Maybe thirty to forty percent of Resolute's available computing infrastructure. Navigation, life support, critical systems are isolated—they won't be affected. But general networks, entertainment systems, non-essential processing? People will notice slowdowns."

"Will that be a problem?"

Torres shrugs. "Depends how Commander Varro prioritizes it. This investigation versus crew morale during a four-day stranding."

"Let me talk to her."

## Varro Authorizes the Investigation

"Ma'am, I need to run forensic AI models on the recovered drive data. Chief Engineer Torres says it'll consume thirty to forty percent of ship computing capacity while running."

Varro looks up from damage reports. "How long?"

"Continuously for the next four days. Maybe longer if we want complete reconstruction."

"What will that affect?"

"General networks, entertainment systems, non-essential processing. Navigation and life support are isolated. But people will notice their terminals are slow, personal devices lag, that sort of thing."

Varro considers. "We're stranded for four days anyway. Everyone's doing medical duty and damage assessment. They can live with slow networks if it means finding who got eighty-one people killed."

"Some might complain—"

"Let them complain to me. Do it. This investigation takes priority."

"Thank you, ma'am. I'll inform Chief Torres."

## Day One-Two: Building the Reader

Torres and her team work methodically. They've already done the impossible once today—building phase-shield generators in thirty-five minutes. This is slower, more precise work.

She fabricates quantum scanners, electron-state sensors, magnetic field analyzers. The equipment looks nothing like proper forensics gear but operates on the same fundamental principles.

Six hours later, the memory core reader is complete.

"Reading core one..." Torres watches electron-state maps build on her display. "Two... three... four. We have complete physical extraction."

Tanaka watches data stream across the screen—meaningless strings of binary, electrons captured in quantum states across microscopic storage matrices. Terabytes of it.

"That's everything that was on the drive," Torres says. "Every bit of data physically stored before the wipe. Now comes the hard part."

She initiates the reconstruction AI. "This will analyze access patterns—which sectors were modified when, in what sequence. Works backwards from most recent to oldest. The files Webb accessed right before the wipe should emerge first."

"How long?"

"First file? Could be minutes, could be an hour. Depends on how fragmented the data is." Torres pulls up a second screen. "I'll run it continuously. When files reconstruct, they'll appear here."

She makes a note in her engineering log about the computational load. Behind her, she can already hear engineers grumbling about network performance.

Tanaka settles in to wait.

## Day Two: Files Emerge

Twenty-three minutes after the reconstruction AI starts, the first file appears.

"Text document," Torres reports. "Reconstruction confidence 94%. Standard format, recently accessed. Opening now."

Tanaka leans forward, reading:

---
Personal Log - Sarah Miller
[Timestamp: 6 hours before death]

I can't do this anymore. Webb just told me he sent the station coordinates. Not just research data—our actual location. He says it's necessary, that we're "accelerating the contradictions" or some ideological nonsense.

I signed up to stick it to the system by selling research they're hoarding. I didn't sign up to get people killed.

I'm out. I'm telling him tomorrow. If he doesn't back down, I'm going to Tanaka.

This has gone too far.
---

"That's it," Tanaka breathes. "She was going to expose him."

"And six hours later she was dead," Torres says quietly. "Want me to keep the reconstruction running?"

"Yes. Everything you can get. How many more files?"

Torres checks the analysis. "AI is projecting... maybe forty files in the next few hours. Hundreds more over the next days. Thousands over weeks. The full drive? That'll take proper forensic systems."

"Keep working. I need to start narrowing suspects."

Over the next four hours, files emerge in reverse chronological order:

**Hour 1:**
- Miller's final log entry
- Webb's meeting notes from two weeks prior (partially reconstructed)
- Encrypted message (binary intact, decryption needed)

**Hour 2:**
- Research data files stolen from Adeyemi's project
- Supply schedule marked with "SENT" annotation
- More encrypted messages
- Ideological documents (democracy arguments, movement materials)

**Hour 3:**
- Earlier Miller logs showing her recruitment
- Webb's handwritten notes (scanned documents)
- Station schematics with security gaps highlighted
- More encrypted traffic

**Hour 4:**
- Meeting locations noted (neutral stations, commercial hubs)
- References to "Aurelius" (handler's alias)
- Payment records (Miller paid in commercial credits)
- Timeline showing eight months of operation

Tanaka reviews each file as it emerges. Not complete—many are partial reconstructions, fragments waiting for more data blocks. The encrypted messages will take weeks to crack. Some proprietary formats are corrupted.

But she has enough.

Miller's log proves motive. The meeting notes show operational planning. The research files prove espionage. The timeline proves sustained betrayal.

"I have what I need," she tells Torres. "Keep the reconstruction running. When we get back to Intelligence, they'll need everything for the tribunal. But right now, I can break him."

Torres nods. "The AI will keep working. Estimate another hundred files in the next twelve hours, but mostly fragments. Full picture? That'll take the forensics lab weeks."

"Weeks we have. Right now, I just need enough to make him talk."

## Day Two-Three: Background Effects of AI Processing

Throughout the ship, people notice the slowdowns.

In crew quarters, Legionary Park tries to load personal messages. The screen buffers, freezes, stutters.

"Anyone else's terminal running like garbage?" he asks.

"Same here," Rodriguez confirms. "Tried to stream a training vid earlier. Took twenty minutes to load."

Kim looks up from her bunk. "Entertainment system's completely borked. Tried to watch something, gave up after ten minutes of buffering."

"Think something's broken?" Park wonders.

"Nah," Rodriguez says. "Probably just low priority during emergency status. Ship's prioritizing critical systems."

They don't know that thirty-five percent of Resolute's computing infrastructure is dedicated to forensic AI models, painstakingly reconstructing deleted files from raw binary data.

But they feel the impact.

In engineering, a curious junior engineer asks: "Chief, why are the forensic models so much more demanding than, say, navigation AI?"

Torres pulls up a comparison. "Navigation AI is trained for one specific task: calculate jump trajectories. Optimized, efficient, runs on dedicated hardware. Forensic reconstruction AI? It's doing something completely different."

She highlights the active processes. "The models have to analyze raw binary data with no file structure. That means testing millions of possible block arrangements per file. Then running format detection across hundreds of known formats. Then error-checking."

"And that takes this much processing?"

"Pattern recognition at this scale requires massive parallel computation. The AI is brute-forcing its way through combinatorial space—trying arrangements until it finds patterns. It's not elegant. It's just powerful."

Kowalski appears at Tanaka's workspace. "Lieutenant, I'm hearing complaints about network performance."

"Forensic AI reconstruction. Running continuously on ship's main processors."

"That's what's slowing everything down?"

"AI models use massive parallel processing. The models are analyzing millions of possible arrangements per second to reconstruct each file."

Kowalski nods. "People are griping about slow terminals and buffering."

"I know. Commander Varro authorized it. This investigation takes priority."

"What should I tell them?"

"Tell them we're hunting who got eighty-one people killed. They can live with slow networks for a few days."

Kowalski smiles slightly. "That'll shut down the complaints."

## Day Three: Interrogations Begin

With sixty-three files reconstructed and more emerging hourly, Tanaka begins interrogating her five suspects.

Two of them—Tech Specialist Parker and Support Tech Park—are nervous. Evasive. But when pressed about their movements, they break quickly.

"All right, fine," Parker admits. "We were running an unauthorized distillery. Completely against regs, I know, but—"

"A distillery," Tanaka says flatly.

"Small batch. Just for personal use, maybe some trade. We weren't hurting anyone."

Park nods miserably. "We can show you the setup. It's in Storage Bay Four-C. That's where we were during... during when Miller died."

Tanaka investigates. The distillery exists—crude but functional. Other crew members confirm Parker and Park were there during the relevant timeframe, arguing about fermentation temperatures.

Tanaka eliminates them as suspects. Soldiers being soldiers.

Dr. Kwan and Legionary Davis both have solid alibis—Kwan was in the commissary with a dozen witnesses, Davis was on duty in the armory with logged access times.

That leaves Dr. Marcus Webb.

## Day Three: Webb's First Interrogation

Webb's alibi is too detailed. Repeated exactly the same way every time. He claims he was in Lab Seven working on xenobiology samples, alone, during the timeframe.

"Walk me through what you were doing," Tanaka says.

"Analyzing protein structures from the Kepler-442 samples. Standard spectroscopy work."

"What were you looking for?"

"Amino acid chirality, evidence of—"

"Be specific. Which amino acids?"

"The standard twenty. Looking for left-handed versus right-handed—"

"You said 'standard spectroscopy work.' What specific technique?"

Webb pauses, just briefly. "Mass spectrometry. Running samples through the—"

"Lab Seven doesn't have a mass spectrometer. That's Lab Three."

"I meant Lab Three—"

"You said Lab Seven. Twice."

Webb's confidence flickers. "I misspoke. I was in Lab Three."

Tanaka makes notes. He's prepared, but not perfectly. The cracks are showing.

She presses on education, background, station procedures. Webb uses idioms that don't match his stated colony of origin. Describes research he supposedly did but gets technical details wrong. Claims nine years at Obsidian but doesn't know basic station facts.

Tanaka can't prove anything yet. But she's suspicious.

## Day Three-Four: Webb's Mistake

After the drive wipe deadline passed, Webb relaxed. He thought the evidence was gone.

In follow-up questioning, he's less careful. Confuses details about his work. Describes the Phase Lab as being on Deck Three when it's Deck Five. References working with Dr. Chen on materials testing—but Dr. Chen has been dead for six years.

"I misspoke—"

"You've misspoken a lot, Dr. Webb. Lab locations. Colleague names. Research you supposedly conducted."

Tanaka lays out the reconstructed files from Torres's memory core work.

"The data drive wiped itself forty-eight hours ago. I know you've been counting down. Felt pretty good when the deadline passed, didn't it?"

Webb says nothing, but his expression confirms it.

"Chief Engineer Torres recovered everything. Memory core direct-read. Every file you thought was erased? I have it."

She places printouts in front of him. "Your handwriting on meeting notes. Messages to external relays—we'll crack the encryption eventually. Timeline logs. And Sarah Miller's final entry: 'Webb is going too far. I'm out.' Timestamped six hours before she died."

Webb stares at the documents.

"You recruited Miller. Convinced her the Confederation was corrupt. She helped you for months. Then you sent station coordinates to the Krell. When she realized you'd put everyone in danger, she wanted out. You argued. It got physical. You killed her."

"You can't prove—"

"I can prove all of it. Eighty-one people died because you told the Krell where to find us."

## Day Four: The Ideological Debate

Webb's facade cracks. The ideology comes out.

"The Confederation is rich," he says. "Technology, ships, abundance. Why should only citizens control it?"

"Because citizens earned that right through service."

"Service some people can't give." His voice hardens. "A farmer feeds the fleet his whole life but never gets a vote. Where's the justice?"

"Civilian service exists. Twelve years in vital roles—"

"Twelve years of exclusion for people who contribute every day." Webb leans forward. "The system creates a permanent underclass. That's tyranny."

Tanaka sits back. "Earth had democracies. Pure, everyone-votes democracy. They lasted maybe two centuries before tearing themselves apart. The Republic has endured for four hundred years."

"Because it's rigged."

"Because it works. You think this is new? Four hundred years ago, dissidents made the same arguments. You know what they did? Ran for office. Worked within the system. Established the tiered citizenship model we have now. Change through legitimate means."

"And if the Republic refuses to change?"

"Then you accept it or leave. You don't murder colleagues and sell people to an enemy."

Webb meets her eyes with absolute certainty. "I didn't want anyone to die."

"But they did. Eighty-one of them. Including Sarah Miller, who trusted you."

Silence.

Tanaka sees it clearly. He believes. Facts about the Republic's success, Earth's failures, legitimate paths for reform—none of it matters. His ideology is a wall no evidence can penetrate.

You can't convince fanatics with facts.

"You can have whatever political opinions you want, Dr. Webb," Tanaka says. "That's not a crime. But murder is. Espionage is. Treason is."

She stands. "You're under arrest for the murder of Sarah Miller, espionage against the Confederation, and treason. You'll be confined under guard until we return to Confederation space, then face tribunal."

"The evidence—"

"Is overwhelming. Your handler taught you ideology, but not data security. We'll find them. We'll dismantle the network."

Webb's expression shifts. "My handler—"

"Yes. 'Aurelius,' or whatever name they used. Someone in authority recruited you. We'll find them."

She signals the guard. "Take him to confinement. Full security. No communications."

As Webb is led away, he says: "The ideas don't die. People see the inequality."

"Then they should run for office," Tanaka replies. "Like those dissidents four hundred years ago. That's how republics reform."

"And if the system won't reform?"

"Then they live with it. Because the alternative—what you did—proves why the Republic demands commitment before granting voice. Eighty-one people are dead because of your ideology."

## Day Four: Tanaka's Final Report

Tanaka finds Commander Varro reviewing jump cell fabrication progress.

"Ma'am, the investigation is complete. Webb is guilty—murder, espionage, treason. I have evidence for all three."

"The wiped drive?"

"Chief Engineer Torres extracted physical data from the storage cores. We're using AI reconstruction to reassemble files—works in reverse chronological order. We've recovered about seventy files so far. Full drive will take weeks back at Intelligence, but we have enough."

Tanaka lays out her evidence. "Miller's final log entry shows she tried to back out. Webb killed her six hours later. We have meeting notes, stolen research data, communications showing he sent station coordinates to the Krell weeks ago. The attack was timed to our arrival."

She thinks of her own path—eight years as an enlisted legionary before earning citizenship through military service. The moment she'd taken the oath, she'd felt it: belonging. The bond of Fides. Webb served nine years and never had that.

"How many dead because of him?"

"Eighty-one, ma'am."

Varro's expression hardens. "Anyone else involved?"

"That's my concern. Webb had a handler—someone senior who recruited him. Used tradecraft: alias 'Aurelius,' disguise, dead drops. We're still reconstructing encrypted messages, but there's an underground movement. Webb is one cell."

"Recommendations?"

"When we return: I'll lead a Counter-Intelligence investigation. Hunt the handler, map the network. The forensics lab will fully decode the drive—every message, every contact. If they turned Webb, they can recruit anywhere."

Varro nods. "You have my authorization. We can't have traitors undermining us from within."

"Thank you, ma'am. The files we're still reconstructing should give us more—meeting locations, operational details. But it'll take time. The AI is processing thousands of data blocks."

"Time we have. For now, make sure Webb is secure."

"He is, ma'am. Under guard, no communications. When we return, he faces tribunal."

"He'll face justice. All of them will."

## Memorial Service

On the third day of their isolation in deep space, Varro convenes a memorial service for the fallen.

The ceremony demonstrates the Confederation's religious pluralism. Chaplains from five different faith traditions lead their respective services: a Christian minister, a Muslim imam, a Buddhist monk, a Hindu priest, and a humanist celebrant. Personnel choose which service to attend based on their own beliefs, or attend multiple services.

Chen attends the humanist service with what remains of his century. Thirty-four legionaries, standing at attention.

Kowalski reads the names of the fallen. Forty-six legionary names, spoken slowly, deliberately.

When he reaches "Legionary Marcus Thompson," Chen feels the weight settle fully. Thompson volunteered. Not for glory, not for honor. For duty. So his brothers could escape. So the Krell would get nothing.

The humanist celebrant speaks: "We honor these fallen not because they died for abstractions—for governments or flags or grand ideals. We honor them because they did their duty. They embodied the values we hold sacred: Virtus in the face of danger, Pietas to their comrades and the people they protected, Fides to their oaths. They were excellent at their craft, devoted to their duty, and true to their word. These are the virtues that transcend belief systems, that unite us despite our different traditions."

After the service, Chen's surviving contubernium gathers privately. Six of them now—Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Davis, Kim, and Okonkwo.

Thompson's absence is a wound that won't heal.

"He didn't do it for glory," Rodriguez says quietly. "He did it for us. So we could get out. So we could win."

"That's what contubernia mean," Chen agrees. "Primary loyalty to your brothers. Everything else is secondary."

They stand together in silence, bound by something deeper than words. The Confederation has values and ideals, but what matters in combat is simpler: the people you live with, train with, fight with.

Six now. Not seven.

Thompson died protecting that. It's enough.

## Act I Closing

In the makeshift command center, Chen and Varro review combat footage from his helmet cam.

They watch legionaries phase through solid matter, position themselves inside enemy formations, materialize at point-blank range for devastating gladius strikes.

"What if," Chen says slowly, "we didn't just use this defensively? What if we boarded them?"

Varro's eyes light up. "Get me Torres, Adeyemi, and every tactical officer on this ship. We need to war-game this."

Meanwhile, Tanaka continues monitoring the AI reconstruction. Files emerge every hour—more evidence, more contacts, more operational details. Webb's network is bigger than one station.

The Krell are weaponizing resentment through underground democratic movements. The investigation has just begun.

And in a secured cabin, Dr. Adeyemi examines the mysterious object he recovered from the planet's surface. Its geometric patterns seem to shift in the light. He doesn't understand what it is, where it came from, or who made it.

But he knows two things: it inspired the greatest breakthrough in military technology in a generation. And the mathematics underlying that breakthrough eerily mirror jump drive principles.

What does that mean? he wonders. And what else might it teach us?

In four days, Resolute will jump back to Confederation space with thirty-four surviving legionaries, revolutionary technology, evidence of an underground conspiracy, and questions that will reshape everything.
