What's Working
Time Structure
The 6-week timeline from return to Confederation space through Typhon battle allows for systematic development. Shows progression from improvisation to doctrine.
Technology Evolution
Shield improvements (90 seconds → 3-5 minutes) feel earned through Torres' engineering work. VLC development from flashlight Morse to standardized protocols shows realistic iteration.
Multiple Parallel Plots
Three threads (technology refinement, Tanaka's investigation, tactical development) interweave effectively without feeling scattered.
Mathematical Breakthrough
Torres-Adeyemi collaboration producing warp corridor theory creates intellectual excitement while setting up Act III technology. The "different institutions learning to work together" theme lands well.
Staggered Materialization Innovation
The tactical evolution from "everyone materializes at once" to "appear in waves creating confusion" demonstrates professional adaptation and systematic learning.
Webb Subplot Payoff
Investigation revealing citizenship system vulnerability creates stakes beyond immediate combat. Tanaka's methodical approach feels authentic to intelligence work.
Battle Scale Increase
Twenty shuttles and 240 legionaries vs. twelve Krell warships shows doctrine scaling from desperation (Obsidian) to planned operation (Typhon).
Combined Arms Integration
VLC coordination, pre-positioned ambushes, drone swarms, heavy weapons—shows Shield Doctrine as sophisticated system, not single trick.

What's Not Working
Compressed Timeline
Six weeks of development, training, and refinement happens in summary rather than scenes. Need to show the work, not just tell readers it happened.
Training Montage Instead of Training Scenes
"They trained extensively" is mentioned but not shown. Need to see legionaries learning to overcome phase-shock, drilling staggered materialization, failing and improving.
Kwan Subplot Underdeveloped
Dr. Kwan appears, gets arrested—but we never meet her, understand her motivations, or see the arrest. Feels like plot convenience rather than character story.
Tactical Sequence Repetition
Boarding multiple ships using similar tactics risks feeling repetitive. Need to vary scenarios—some easy, some hard, some surprising.
Missing Failure States
Two groups fail (Delta and Echo) but failures described in summary. Need to show failure in detail so readers understand stakes and costs.
Weak Character Moments
The technology and tactics dominate; character development gets minimal space. Need personal relationships, growth, conflicts beyond professional competence.
Engineering Corps vs. Scientific Track Rivalry
Mentioned but not shown in action. Need scenes demonstrating institutional differences and how collaboration overcomes them.
VLC Network Degradation
Described as happening but not shown. Need to experience communication network collapsing under combat conditions.
Limited Emotional Impact
Casualties happen but don't hit emotionally. Need to care about the 240 legionaries before some die so losses matter.
Rushed Aftermath
Post-battle moves immediately to strategic discussion. Need breathing room—medical treatment, memorial services, personal processing of trauma.
