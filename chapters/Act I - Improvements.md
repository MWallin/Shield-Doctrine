What's Working in v5
Strong Opening Hook
The mysterious artifact discovery creates immediate intrigue while the Krell attack provides action. The combination of ancient technology mystery and immediate danger hooks readers effectively.

Clear Character Introduction
Chen, Varro, Torres, and Adeyemi are introduced with distinct personalities and competencies. Each character's role is clear and their professional excellence established quickly.

Effective Tension Escalation
The progression from discovery → leak → attack → desperate defense → improvised solution → risky extraction creates natural escalating tension without feeling forced.

Technology Introduction
Phase-shields introduced organically through desperate need. The 90-second limitation and disorientation effects create immediate stakes and constraints that feel realistic.

Tactical Innovation
Chen's improvised use of phase-shields (position while phased, materialize at point-blank range, gladius combat) establishes the core tactical concept that will develop throughout the story.

Mystery Setup
The artifact's unknown origin, the mathematical connection to jump drives, and Webb's betrayal all set up threads that continue through later acts.

Professional Competence
Characters succeed through skill and adaptation, not luck. Torres fabricating shields in 14 minutes, Chen leading under extreme stress, Varro making correct emergency decisions—all demonstrate competence.

Mathematical Connection Established Early (v5 addition)
Adeyemi notices the similarity between phase-shield mathematics and jump drive principles immediately (lines 21-36). He doesn't include this in his transmission, but the observation is made. This sets up Torres-Adeyemi collaboration in Act II organically.

Contubernium Structure Detailed (v5 addition)
Chen's 8-man team is specifically named: Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Williams, Hassan, Kim, Okonkwo (line 70). Their roles and relationships are established before combat, making casualties more meaningful.

Specific Unit Organization (v5 addition)
The garrison is precisely defined: 80 legionaries organized into 10 contubernia of 8 soldiers each (line 60-61). Casualties reduce them to 68 effectives (line 88). This specificity grounds the action.

Religious Pluralism Shown (v5 addition)
Memorial service demonstrates Confederation's multi-faith approach with 5 chaplains: Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and humanist (lines 280-291). Personnel choose which service(s) to attend.

Historical Context for Traditions (v5 addition)
Chen's grandfather was a First Generation legionary 150 years ago (line 62). The gladius Chen carries belonged to him (lines 63, 104). This links current events to founding traditions, showing cultural continuity.

Specific Tactical Numbers (v5 addition)
160 rescued personnel, 40 injured from high-g extraction (line 221), 42 legionaries KIA (line 278). The costs are specific and tracked, not vague.

What's Not Working (Still Needs Expansion in v5)
Rushed Opening Section
The transition from artifact discovery to Krell attack still happens quickly. While v5 establishes the three-week timeline (lines 10-18), we don't experience Adeyemi's research process in detail. Need to show the weeks of study, failed experiments, and incremental progress.

Webb Only Exists in Exposition
Webb is mentioned as traitor through Tanaka's investigation but we never meet him alive, see his perspective, or understand his emotional journey. His betrayal feels like plot device rather than character tragedy (lines 254-273).

Limited Pre-Crisis Worldbuilding
We see the station during crisis, but limited daily life beforehand. What's normal routine? How do researchers and legionaries interact? What makes this community worth saving beyond strategic importance?

Artifact Discovery in Summary
Adeyemi's surface expedition is told in past tense summary (lines 8-18). Need to experience the discovery moment in real-time—the desolation, the find, his excitement and secrecy.

Supporting Cast Underdeveloped
While Chen's contubernium is named (v5 improvement), other legionaries remain anonymous. Decanus Johnson is mentioned posthumously (line 287), but we never met him. Need to establish more individuals before they die.

Combat Sequences Could Be More Visceral
The gladius combat and phase-shock are described (lines 110-152), but could be more sensory and immediate. Readers need to feel the nausea, the wrongness, the violence physically.

Extraction Injuries Told Not Felt
We're told bones break during high-g extraction (line 216), but we don't experience specific people's trauma. Need individual stories of injury and pain.

Tanaka Investigation in Summary
Her discovery of Webb's betrayal is efficient exposition (lines 254-273), but we don't see her methodical investigation work. Her suspicious nature is told, not shown.

Limited Emotional Processing
The memorial service exists (v5 addition), but immediate grief and shock after combat is brief. People process trauma differently—need varied reactions.
