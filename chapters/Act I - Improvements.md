## What's Working in v7

**Strong Opening Hook**
The mysterious artifact discovery creates immediate intrigue while the Krell attack provides action. The combination of ancient technology mystery and immediate danger hooks readers effectively.

Clear Character Introduction
Chen, Varro, Torres, and Adeyemi are introduced with distinct personalities and competencies. Each character's role is clear and their professional excellence established quickly.

Effective Tension Escalation
The progression from discovery → leak → attack → desperate defense → improvised solution → risky extraction creates natural escalating tension without feeling forced.

Technology Introduction
Phase-shields introduced organically through desperate need. The 90-second limitation and disorientation effects create immediate stakes and constraints that feel realistic.

Tactical Innovation
Chen's improvised use of phase-shields (position while phased, materialize at point-blank range, gladius combat) establishes the core tactical concept that will develop throughout the story.

Mystery Setup
The artifact's unknown origin, the mathematical connection to jump drives, and Webb's betrayal all set up threads that continue through later acts.

**Professional Competence**
Characters succeed through skill and adaptation, not luck. Torres fabricating shields in 35 minutes with real challenges, Chen leading under extreme stress, Varro making correct emergency decisions, Tanaka's methodical investigation—all demonstrate competence.

**Investigation Subplot Integrated (v7 addition)**
The murder mystery unfolds naturally through the rescue timeline. Rodriguez/Park discover Miller's body before the Krell attack. Tanaka's investigation is interrupted by combat, then continues during the 4-day stranding. The investigation demonstrates professional detective work, not exposition.

**Realistic Data Forensics (v7 addition)**
Torres building the memory core reader in 6 hours shows engineering expertise. AI reconstruction consuming 30-40% of ship processing demonstrates computational costs. Files emerging reverse chronologically over hours/days creates realistic timeline. Not magic—brute-force pattern recognition.

**Ideological Antagonist (v7 addition)**
Webb as ideological plant (not victim) creates compelling debate. Democracy vs Republic argument explores citizenship themes without preaching. Tanaka's interrogation shows you can't convince fanatics with facts. Webb believes his ideology despite consequences—realistic portrayal of radicalization.

**Act II Setup Integrated (v7 addition)**
"Aurelius" handler and underground movement established through investigation. Webb as one cell of larger network. Tanaka's Counter-Intelligence investigation continuing. Sets up Act II conspiracy subplot organically without telegraphing.

**AI Processing Load Effects (v7 addition)**
Crew experiencing network slowdowns throughout ship. Terminals buffering, entertainment systems lagging. Engineering team complaining about slow damage assessments. Shows AI isn't magic—has computational costs that impact operations.

**Engineering Challenges Realistic (v7 addition)**
Torres's 35-minute build shows real problem-solving: harmonic interference, power coupling issues, improvised solutions using jump drive regulators. Conference call collaboration with Adeyemi. Shield duration variance (5-25 minutes) acknowledged as uncertainty, not glossed over.

**Mathematical Connection Established Early (v5/v7)
Adeyemi notices the similarity between phase-shield mathematics and jump drive principles immediately (lines 21-36). He doesn't include this in his transmission, but the observation is made. This sets up Torres-Adeyemi collaboration in Act II organically.

Contubernium Structure Detailed (v5 addition)
Chen's 8-man team is specifically named: Rodriguez, Park, Martinez, Williams, Hassan, Kim, Okonkwo (line 70). Their roles and relationships are established before combat, making casualties more meaningful.

Specific Unit Organization (v5 addition)
The garrison is precisely defined: 80 legionaries organized into 10 contubernia of 8 soldiers each (line 60-61). Casualties reduce them to 68 effectives (line 88). This specificity grounds the action.

Religious Pluralism Shown (v5 addition)
Memorial service demonstrates Confederation's multi-faith approach with 5 chaplains: Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and humanist (lines 280-291). Personnel choose which service(s) to attend.

Historical Context for Traditions (v5 addition)
Chen's grandfather was a First Generation legionary 150 years ago (line 62). The gladius Chen carries belonged to him (lines 63, 104). This links current events to founding traditions, showing cultural continuity.

**Specific Tactical Numbers (v5/v7)**
Casualties tracked specifically: 81 total dead, 139 wounded. 120 civilians survived from 170 aboard. 34 legionaries survived from 80. Thompson's sacrifice named and shown. Costs are specific and meaningful.

**Thompson's Sacrifice (v7 addition)**
Combat engineer staying behind to blow reactor is named character from Chen's contubernium. Decision shown, not told. Chen wrestling with necessity. Thompson calm and professional. "Your family will know you did your duty." Makes sacrifice personal and meaningful.

**Character Consistency Maintained (v7 addition)**
Chen's 18 years service corrected. Williams → Thompson name change preserves Sarah Williams for Act III. Hassan → Davis preserves Jamal Hassan for Act III. Varro's enlisted background (8 years) added and integrated into her perspective.

## What's Not Working (Still Needs Expansion in v7)

**Rushed Opening Section**
The transition from artifact discovery to Krell attack still happens quickly. While the three-week timeline is established, we don't experience Adeyemi's research process in detail. Need to show the weeks of study, failed experiments, and incremental progress.

**Webb's Pre-Crisis Characterization (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED in v7)**
v7 improvement: Webb now appears as living character during interrogation with ideological debate, making him a compelling antagonist rather than plot device.

Still needed: Webb's pre-crisis life on station not shown. We meet him only during interrogation. Need to see his alienation developing, his recruitment, his rationalization. Make readers understand (not agree with) his path to betrayal before it happens.

Limited Pre-Crisis Worldbuilding
We see the station during crisis, but limited daily life beforehand. What's normal routine? How do researchers and legionaries interact? What makes this community worth saving beyond strategic importance?

Artifact Discovery in Summary
Adeyemi's surface expedition is told in past tense summary (lines 8-18). Need to experience the discovery moment in real-time—the desolation, the find, his excitement and secrecy.

Supporting Cast Underdeveloped
While Chen's contubernium is named (v5 improvement), other legionaries remain anonymous. Decanus Johnson is mentioned posthumously (line 287), but we never met him. Need to establish more individuals before they die.

Combat Sequences Could Be More Visceral
The gladius combat and phase-shock are described (lines 110-152), but could be more sensory and immediate. Readers need to feel the nausea, the wrongness, the violence physically.

Extraction Injuries Told Not Felt
We're told bones break during high-g extraction (line 216), but we don't experience specific people's trauma. Need individual stories of injury and pain.

**Tanaka Investigation (ADDRESSED in v7)**
v7 improvement: Investigation shown through multiple scenes:
- Murder discovery by Rodriguez/Park
- Tanaka identifying 5 suspects, tracing unauthorized transmissions
- Interrogating Morrison/Park (distillery red herring)
- Eliminating alibis for Kwan and Davis
- Webb's interrogation with ideological debate
- Data forensics with Torres building memory core reader
- Files emerging reverse chronologically
- Final report to Varro with Act II setup

Her methodical, suspicious nature demonstrated through action, not told.

Limited Emotional Processing
The memorial service exists (v5 addition), but immediate grief and shock after combat is brief. People process trauma differently—need varied reactions.
