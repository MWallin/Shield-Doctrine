What's Working
Rushed Development Theme
The 16-month timeline feeling incomplete creates realistic tension. Not everyone is fully trained, technology isn't perfected, doctrine still being refined—feels authentic to real military development.
Mixed Readiness Levels
Three cohorts of boarding specialists (elite/capable/marginal) creates realistic force composition. Shows Shield Doctrine scaling beyond initial test group.
Command Skepticism
Stone's "this is insane, you're barely ready" conversation establishes genuine doubt about Hammerfall's success. Makes eventual victory more satisfying.
Ground-Level Perspective
Rodriguez (second cohort, incomplete training) and Hassan (rear-echelon guard) provide perspectives beyond elite specialists. Shows entire force structure contributing.
Warp Corridor Vulnerability
75% success rate, carrier positioning constraints, anchor assembly under fire—all create genuine tactical challenges and stakes.
Okonkwo's Failure Adaptation
Team whose anchor fails switching to disruption mission shows professional adaptation. Demonstrates mission command doctrine and resilience.
Captain Park's Sacrifice
Resolute holding position despite critical damage to maintain corridors creates meaningful sacrifice. Professional decision with real cost.
Hammerfall Scale
24 Javelins, 576 personnel, targeting four dreadnoughts simultaneously shows doctrine at operational scale, not just small-unit tactics.
Aftermath Assessment
Post-battle recognition that it worked despite rushed preparation shows honest evaluation. Doctrine proven but needs refinement.
Epilogue Mystery
Artifact study, Krell warnings about galactic core, colony ships missing—sets up future stories while maintaining mystery.

What's Not Working
Time Skip Too Abrupt
Sixteen months summarized in a few paragraphs. Need to show development process, not just state it happened.
Training Facility Development Missing
How did they build the infrastructure? Where? Who designed it? This worldbuilding matters for understanding Confederation's capability.
Character Development Gaps
Major time skip but characters haven't changed much. Need to show how 16 months affected them—relationships, growth, struggles.
Combat Engineer Perspective Thin
Williams and his team are mentioned but underdeveloped. Their 23% casualty rate deserves more exploration.
Rodriguez's Team Underexplored
His incomplete training and team losses described but not deeply felt. Need to experience their story, not just hear summary.
Hammerfall Planning Sequence Brief
From authorization to launch feels rushed. Need extended planning, preparation, personal moments before massive battle.
Individual Javelin Operations Repetitive
Twenty-four teams boarding ships risks feeling same-y. Need to vary scenarios, challenges, and outcomes significantly.
VLC in Practice Undershown
Described as important but not shown operating and degrading during combat. Should experience communication challenges.
Carrier Battle Perspective Thin
Park's sacrifice powerful but brief. Need to experience her bridge, her decisions, her crew's perspective.
Missing Mid-Battle Complications
Hammerfall proceeds fairly smoothly after initial setbacks. Need more things going wrong requiring adaptation.
Emotional Processing Rushed
136 KIA is significant but aftermath moves quickly to strategic discussion. Need space for grief, memorial, consequences.
Political Aftermath Minimal
Senate reactions, public response, strategic implications mentioned but not explored. This victory changes everything politically.
Citizenship Reform Implementation
Mentioned but not shown. Need to see how three-tier system actually works, who qualifies, how it affects people.
Technology Limitations Underemphasized
Warp corridors work well enough that constraints don't feel binding. Need more failures, more complications, more struggle.
