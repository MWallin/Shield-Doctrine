## Engineering Corps

### Motto and Cultural Identity

**Motto**: "We Build to Last"

**Cultural Identity**:
The Engineering Corps sees itself as the Republic's foundation—literally and metaphorically. Every habitable space, every functional system, every maintained infrastructure exists because of Corps engineers. They are problem-solvers, builders, and the reason civilization survives in hostile space.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Infrastructure is sacred**: What we build outlasts us; build it right
- **Redundancy saves lives**: Single points of failure kill; always have backup
- **Practical over perfect**: Working solution today beats perfect solution never
- **Teaching is duty**: Every engineer must train replacements
