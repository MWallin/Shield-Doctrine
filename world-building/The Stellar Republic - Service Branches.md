# The Stellar Republic - Service Branches

## Document Summary

This document provides an overview and comparison of the Republic's six service branches. Each branch is an "institution larger than life" that shapes cultural identity and provides pathways to citizenship through meaningful service. While all branches share a common structural framework (see General Service Structure.md), each has distinct mission, culture, and specializations.

**The Six Branches:**
1. Engineering Corps (~150,000) - Infrastructure builders
2. Medical Service (~100,000) - Healthcare providers and researchers
3. Scientific Expedition (~75,000) - Explorers and scientists
4. Civic Administration (~200,000) - Governors, judges, educators
5. Stellar Legion Service (~1,270,000) - Military defenders
6. Vigiles Service (~840,000) - Emergency response (police, fire, rescue)

**For detailed information on each branch, see individual branch documents.**

## Overview: The Six Service Branches

The Republic's strength lies not just in military power but in six equally prestigious service branches. Each is an institution that shapes cultural identity, provides clear paths to citizenship and advancement, and serves essential functions for Republic welfare.

### Core Principle: Service Earns Citizenship

All six branches exist to provide pathways to citizenship through meaningful service. Service must be:
- **Genuine contribution** to Republic welfare (not make-work)
- **Physically or intellectually demanding** (tests commitment)
- **Long enough to demonstrate dedication** (8 years minimum for Resident Citizenship)
- **Equally valid regardless of branch** (no hierarchy of citizenship—engineering service equals military service equals medical service)

### Why Six Branches?

The Republic recognizes that civilization requires diverse expertise:
- **Defense** (Stellar Legions): Protect against external threats
- **Order & Safety** (Vigiles): Maintain internal security and respond to emergencies
- **Infrastructure** (Engineering Corps): Build and maintain the physical systems supporting life
- **Health** (Medical Service): Care for citizens and advance longevity
- **Knowledge** (Scientific Expedition): Explore unknown space and advance science
- **Governance** (Civic Administration): Administer laws, educate citizens, provide justice

Each branch addresses fundamental needs. All are genuinely essential; none could be eliminated without serious consequences.

## Branch Comparison

### Size and Personnel

| Branch | Total Personnel | Service Members | Contracted Professionals | Federal/Coordination |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Engineering Corps** | ~150,000 | ~100,000 (67%) | ~35,000 (23%) | ~15,000 (10%) |
| **Medical Service** | ~100,000 | ~68,000 (68%) | ~23,000 (23%) | ~9,000 (9%) |
| **Scientific Expedition** | ~75,000 | ~52,000 (69%) | ~16,000 (21%) | ~7,000 (10%) |
| **Civic Administration** | ~200,000 | ~130,000 (65%) | ~50,000 (25%) | ~20,000 (10%) |
| **Stellar Legion Service** | ~1,270,000 | ~850,000 (67%) | ~320,000 (25%) | ~100,000 (8%) |
| **Vigiles Service** | ~840,000 | ~550,000 (65%) | ~220,000 (26%) | ~70,000 (8%) |
| **TOTAL** | **~2,635,000** | **~1,750,000** | **~664,000** | **~221,000** |

**Key Observation**: All branches follow similar three-tier personnel ratios (roughly 65-70% service members, 20-25% contracted professionals, 5-10% federal coordination), demonstrating the common structural framework.

### Branch Mottos and Identity

| Branch | Motto | Cultural Identity | Prestige Type |
|--------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| **Engineering Corps** | "We Build to Last" | Practical builders, problem-solvers | Essential respect, technical competence |
| **Medical Service** | "In Service of Life" | Healers, humanitarian advocates | Humanitarian respect, saving lives |
| **Scientific Expedition** | "Knowledge Lights the Stars" | Explorers, researchers, risk-takers | Intellectual elite, frontier adventurers |
| **Civic Administration** | "Order Enables Liberty" | Administrators, judges, educators | Necessary respect (less glamorous) |
| **Stellar Legion Service** | "Shields of the Republic" | Warriors, defenders, protectors | Highest prestige, military honor |
| **Vigiles Service** | "Ever Vigilant, Ever Ready" | Emergency responders, everyday heroes | Local respect, practical heroism |

### Prestige Ranking (Public Perception)

While all branches are genuinely respected, public perception creates informal prestige hierarchy:

1. **Stellar Legions** - Highest prestige (military defenders, greatest risk)
2. **Scientific Expedition** - Intellectual elite (explorers, discoverers)
3. **Vigiles Service** - Everyday heroes (local presence, visible service)
4. **Engineering Corps** - Practical respect (builders of everything)
5. **Medical Service** - Humanitarian respect (healers, life-savers)
6. **Civic Administration** - Necessary but less glamorous (bureaucrats, though judges and teachers respected)

**Important Note**: This ranking reflects public glamour, not actual importance. Citizens understand all branches are essential. A teacher or judge performs equally valuable service to a legionary or explorer.

### Risk and Danger Levels

| Branch | Peacetime Fatality Rate | Wartime/Crisis Fatality Rate | Primary Dangers |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Stellar Legions** | 0.5-1% annually | 5-10% annually | Combat, training accidents |
| **Scientific Expedition** | 0.3-0.5% annually | 0.5-1% annually | Exploration accidents, alien environments |
| **Vigiles Service** | 0.2-0.4% annually | 0.5-1% annually | Emergency response, firefighting, confrontations |
| **Engineering Corps** | 0.1-0.2% annually | 0.3-0.5% annually | Construction accidents, equipment failures |
| **Medical Service** | 0.05-0.1% annually | 0.2-0.5% annually | Infectious disease, combat medicine deployments |
| **Civic Administration** | 0.01-0.05% annually | 0.05-0.1% annually | Workplace accidents, very low risk |

**Key Observation**: Higher danger correlates with higher public prestige but not with greater citizenship value. All 8-year service terms earn equal Resident Citizenship regardless of branch.

## Branch Budget Allocation

Federal budget allocation reflects strategic priorities and operational costs:

| Branch | Approximate % of Federal Budget | Primary Cost Drivers |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Stellar Legions** | ~40% | Warships, weapons, training, operations |
| **Vigiles Service** | ~15% | Local stations, equipment, federal support |
| **Medical Service** | ~15% | Hospitals, research, universal healthcare |
| **Engineering Corps** | ~12% | Infrastructure projects, equipment |
| **Civic Administration** | ~10% | Bureaucracy, courts, education system |
| **Scientific Expedition** | ~8% | Exploration vessels, research institutes |
| **TOTAL** | **~100%** | (Federal budget, systems also contribute) |

**Key Observation**: Military (Legions) and domestic security (Vigiles) together consume ~55% of federal budget, reflecting defense priority. However, civilian branches (Medical, Engineering, Scientific, Civic Admin) receive substantial funding (~45%), demonstrating Republic values both strength and civilization.
