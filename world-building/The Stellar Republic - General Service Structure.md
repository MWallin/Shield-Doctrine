# The Stellar Republic - General Service Structure

## Document Purpose

This document defines the common structural framework that applies to all Republic service branches. Individual branches adapt this framework to their specific mission and nature, but all branches share these fundamental organizational principles.

**Current Service Branches:**
1. Engineering Corps
2. Medical Service
3. Scientific Expedition
4. Civic Administration
5. Stellar Legion Service
6. Vigiles Service

---

## Core Principle: Service Earns Citizenship

All branches exist to provide pathways to citizenship through meaningful service to the Republic. Service must be:
- **Genuine contribution** to Republic welfare (not make-work)
- **Physically or intellectually demanding** (tests commitment)
- **Long enough to demonstrate dedication** (8 years minimum)
- **Equally valid regardless of branch** (no hierarchy of service)

---

## Three-Tier Personnel System

All branches employ three categories of personnel with distinct roles:

### 1. Service Members (Earning Citizenship)
- **Typical Age**: 20-28
- **Purpose**: Earning Resident Citizenship through 8-year service term
- **Proportion**: 65-75% of branch workforce
- **Characteristics**: Fresh energy, idealism, physical peak, learning
- **After 8 Years**: Most leave for civilian careers; some continue as contracted professionals

### 2. Contracted Professionals (Career Staff)
- **Status**: Already completed citizenship service (have Resident or Full Citizenship)
- **Purpose**: Provide continuity, expertise, institutional memory, train service members
- **Proportion**: 20-25% of branch workforce
- **Roles**: Supervisors, specialists, trainers, senior practitioners
- **Career Path**: Can pursue Full Citizenship (12 years total service)

### 3. Federal Coordination and Specialists
- **Purpose**: Maintain standards, coordinate across systems, provide specialized capabilities
- **Proportion**: 5-10% of branch workforce
- **Organization**: Federal-level headquarters, regional commands, specialized directorates
- **Capabilities**: Both coordination (set standards, provide oversight) and operational (deploy to reinforce local/system forces)

### Why This Structure Works
- **Quality**: Contracted professionals ensure standards and continuity
- **Energy**: Service members bring fresh perspectives and physical capability
- **Efficiency**: Federal level coordinates without micromanaging
- **Subsidiarity**: Most operations local/system (responsive to local needs)
- **Scalability**: Can adjust ratios based on branch needs

## Standard 8-Year Service Structure

All branches follow this basic progression, adapted to branch-specific requirements:

### Year 1: Foundational Training
- **Common academy** for entire branch (or common core within specializations)
- **Physical conditioning** appropriate to branch demands
- **Republic values**: Citizenship, civic duty, constitutional law, branch history
- **Basic skills**: Core competencies all branch members need
- **Cohort bonding**: Live and train together, form lifelong connections

### Year 2: Specialization Training
- **Choose specialization track** (branches typically offer 4-6 specializations)
- **Intensive training** in chosen specialty
- **Cross-training**: Learn basics of other specializations within branch
- **Graduate and receive assignment** to local/system unit
- **Certification**: Become probationary member in specialty

### Years 3-7: Active Service
- **Frontline operations** at local/system level
- **Increasing responsibility**: Progress from probationary to experienced to senior
- **Supervision**: Work under contracted professionals who mentor and evaluate
- **Deployments**: May serve in different systems, gain varied experience
- **Performance evaluations**: Annual reviews documenting achievements and conduct

### Year 8: Senior Service and Training
- **Leadership roles**: Acting supervisory responsibilities
- **Training new recruits**: Field training officer, academy instructor

- **Can vote** in local/system elections
- **Full federal benefits**: Healthcare, educational access, veterans' preference

---

## Post-Service Pathways

After completing 8-year term, service members have multiple options:

### Continue with Branch (20-25%)
- **Contracted Professionals**: Continue at local/system level as career staff
- **Federal Positions**: Join federal directorate (elite selection, top performers)
- **Path to Full Citizenship**: 12 years total service + examination
- **Why stay**: Love the work, specialization opportunities, clear advancement

### Fast-Track to Another Branch (5%)
- **Credit service years** toward new branch requirement
- **Additional training** in new specialty
- **Rare but encouraged**: Republic values skill diversity
- **Common paths**: Medical ↔ Scientific, Engineering ↔ Scientific, Vigiles ↔ Civic Administration, Legions ↔ Vigiles

## Citizenship Pathways Through Service

All branches provide equal pathways to citizenship (no hierarchy):

### Resident Citizenship (8 Years)
- **Requirement**: Complete 8 years with satisfactory rating in any branch
- **Automatic**: Upon completion, no additional examination
- **Rights**: Vote in local/system elections, full federal benefits, priority education access
- **Most common**: ~70-75% of service members stop here

### Full Citizenship (12 Years)
- **Requirement**: Extended service beyond 8 years + examination
- **Two paths** (consistent across branches):

**Path 1: Extended Service (12 years total)**
- Complete 8 years for Resident Citizenship
- Serve additional 4 years as contracted professional
- Receive "Exemplary" ratings
- Pass Full Citizenship Examination

**Path 2: Exceptional Contribution (Variable)**
- Demonstrate extraordinary achievement in branch field
- Nomination from system/federal authorities
- Abbreviated service (2-4 years) in area of expertise
- Pass Enhanced Citizenship Examination
- **Rare**: Reserved for truly exceptional individuals

### Full Citizenship Examination
- **Covers**: Constitutional law (40%), history/philosophy (30%), practical governance (30%)
- **Format**: Written (12 hours), oral (4 hours), practical scenarios (8 hours)
- **Passing score**: 75% overall
- **Retake**: Once after one year if failed
- **Failure rate**: ~40% first attempt, ~25% never pass
- **Purpose**: Ensure Full Citizens understand Republic governance deeply

## Adaptation by Branch

This framework applies to all branches but allows flexibility:

### Required Elements (Must Have)
- Three-tier personnel system (proportions can vary)
- 8-year service structure (timing can adjust)
- Post-service pathways (all options available)
- Youth programs (format varies by branch)
- Federal/system/local organization (exact structure varies)
- Cultural elements (motto, oath, traditions)
- Integration with other branches

### Flexible Elements (Branch-Specific)
- **Number and type of specializations**: Varies by branch mission
- **Training intensity and duration**: Based on complexity (Medical longer than Vigiles)
- **Federal operational capability**: Varies by need (Vigiles high, Civic Admin lower)
- **Danger level**: Affects recruiting, retention, prestige (Legions high, Civic Admin low)
- **Personnel ratios**: Can adjust 65/25/10 split based on needs
- **Local vs system operations**: Some branches more centralized than others

### Branch Size Variation
- Branches vary greatly in size based on mission needs:
  - **Largest**: Stellar Legions (~1,270,000) - defense requires scale
  - **Large**: Vigiles (~840,000) - local presence everywhere
  - **Medium**: Civic Administration (~200,000), Engineering (~150,000), Medical (~100,000)
  - **Smallest**: Scientific (~75,000) - specialized, elite
- Size reflects mission requirements, not prestige

---

## Future Branches

This framework can accommodate additional branches if Republic needs evolve:

### Criteria for New Branch
- **Distinct mission**: Not duplicating existing branch functions
- **Scale requirement**: Need for 50,000+ personnel (otherwise, directorate within existing branch)
- **Citizenship pathway**: Can provide meaningful 8-year service earning citizenship
- **Local presence**: Requires personnel distributed across systems
- **Cultural identity**: Can develop distinct traditions while fitting Republic values

### Hypothetical Future Branches
- **Diplomatic Corps**: If foreign relations expand dramatically
- **Environmental Service**: If terraforming/ecosystem management becomes major priority
- **Space Traffic Control**: If commercial space traffic requires dedicated service
- **Colonial Establishment**: If new colony founding becomes systematic program

### Process for Creating New Branch
- Federal Senate proposes and debates
- 2/3 majority required (major structural change)
- System ratification (3/4 of systems must approve)
- Multi-year implementation (build infrastructure, train initial cohort)
- Review after 10 years (assess whether separate branch justified)

---

## Summary

The General Service Structure provides a common framework ensuring all branches:
- **Provide equal citizenship pathways** (no hierarchy of service)
- **Maintain quality through standards** (federal oversight)
- **Operate efficiently** (three-tier personnel, local operations)
- **Integrate effectively** (clear protocols, mutual support)
- **Build local connections** (youth programs, community presence)
- **Respect subsidiarity** (federal coordination, local execution)

Individual branches adapt this framework to their specific missions while maintaining common principles that bind them as parts of a unified Republic service system.
