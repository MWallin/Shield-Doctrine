# The Stellar Republic - Auxiliary Forces

## Document Summary

This document details the Auxiliary system—the Republic's force multiplier and integration mechanism that incorporates planetary militaries and specialists into the federal military structure. Modeled on Roman auxiliaries, these forces provide specialized capabilities that standard Legions lack.

**Core Principles:**
- **Permanent Integration**: Auxiliaries attached to specific Legions, train and deploy together
- **Specialized Capabilities**: Provide unique environmental, technical, or cultural expertise
- **Faster Citizenship Path**: 10 years service → Full Citizenship (vs 12 in other branches)
- **System Pride**: Maintain distinct identity while serving federal goals
- **Federal Standards**: Meet federal training and operate under military law

**Five Types of Auxiliaries:**

1. **Environmental Specialists**: Zero-G (Titan Void Walkers), High-Gravity Infantry (Forge World Titans), Desert/Jungle/Aquatic warfare experts adapted to extreme environments

2. **Technical Specialists**: Engineering (Builder's Legion), Electronic Warfare (Signal Ghosts), Advanced Medical (Healer Corps)

3. **Cultural Specialists**: Psy-Ops/Civil Affairs (Nova Diplomats), Scout/Reconnaissance (Aurora Outriders)

4. **Specialized Weapons**: Heavy Armor Units (Iron Brigade), Artillery (Long Reach Battery), Experimental Weapons (Prometheus Squad)

5. **Planetary Defense Integration**: Best militia units transition to Auxiliary service when systems join Republic

**Typical Legion Allocation:**
- Standard Legions: 2,000-3,000 Auxiliaries (30-40% of total strength)
- Assault Legions: 1,500-2,000 (need maximum core marines)
- Garrison Legions: 3,000-4,000 (rely on Auxiliaries for occupation)

**Service Path:** 10 years → Resident Citizenship, 12 years + exam → Full Citizenship, 25 years → Can transfer to full Legionary status

**Integration:** Joint training 6+ months/year, cultural exchange, command integration, shared facilities build cohesion and respect.

## PART VI: AUXILIARY FORCES SYSTEM

The Auxiliary system is the Republic's force multiplier and integration mechanism—a way to incorporate planetary militaries into federal structure while providing specialized capabilities that Legions lack. Modeled on Roman auxiliaries who supplied cavalry, archers, and specialized troops, Republic Auxiliaries provide unique combat capabilities shaped by their home worlds' environments and cultures.

### Philosophy and Structure

**Core Principles**:

1. **Permanent Integration**: Auxiliaries are permanently attached to specific Legions, training and deploying together. This creates cohesion and understanding.

2. **Specialized Capabilities**: Auxiliaries provide what standard Legions don't have—unique environmental adaptations, specialized weapons, cultural expertise, or experimental capabilities.

3. **Path to Citizenship**: Auxiliary service offers faster citizenship than civilian branches (10 years Auxiliary service = Full Citizenship path, vs 12 years in other branches).

4. **System Pride**: Auxiliaries maintain distinct identity, uniforms, and traditions from their home systems while serving federal goals.

5. **Federal Standards**: Despite diversity, all Auxiliaries must meet federal training standards and operate within federal military law.

**Organization**:

**Auxiliary Command** (within each Legion):
- **Tribune of Auxiliaries**: Senior officer (O-5) coordinating all Auxiliary units attached to Legion
- Reports to Legate but manages day-to-day Auxiliary operations
- Liaison between Auxiliary commanders and Legion staff

**Typical Auxiliary Unit Sizes**:
- **Cohort**: 400-800 personnel (most common)
- **Squadron**: 100-200 personnel (smaller specialized units)
- **Company**: 40-80 personnel (very specialized or rare capabilities)

**Legion Auxiliary Allocation**:
- Most Legions: 2,000-3,000 Auxiliaries (30-40% of total Legion strength)
- Assault Legions: 1,500-2,000 Auxiliaries (need maximum marine strength)
- Garrison Legions: 3,000-4,000 Auxiliaries (rely heavily on planetary forces for occupation duties)

**TYPE 5: PLANETARY DEFENSE FORCES INTEGRATION**

When systems join the Republic, existing planetary militias can become Auxiliaries:

**Militia Transition to Auxiliary**:
- System's best units selected for Auxiliary service
- Receive federal training and equipment
- Maintain planetary defense role while available for Legion deployment
- Creates integration and loyalty to Republic

**Example: New Athens Planetary Guard**:
- New Athens joins Republic (2720)
- Planetary Guard: 50,000 personnel, well-trained, experienced in civil defense
- Federal assessment: Select 2,000 best for Auxiliary service
- Form two Auxiliary cohorts attached to Legion IX and Legion XVII
- Remaining 48,000 remain system militia (local defense only)
- After 10 years, many Auxiliaries rotate to full Legion service or return home with federal training

### Auxiliary Service and Citizenship Path

**Standard Service**:
- **10 years service**: Qualifies for Resident Citizenship (same as other branches)
- **Additional 2 years + examination**: Qualifies for Full Citizenship
- **25 years service**: Auxiliary can apply for Legion transfer, becoming full Legionary (fast-track to career military)

**Benefits During Service**:
- **Federal pay**: Auxiliaries receive 80% of equivalent Legion pay (plus system bonuses)
- **Training**: Access to federal military schools and advanced training
- **Equipment**: Issued federal equipment (though may use specialized home-world gear)
- **Medical**: Full federal military healthcare
- **Family support**: Families receive federal benefits during service

**Benefits After Service**:
- **Veterans' benefits**: Land grants, education assistance, healthcare, pensions
- **Skill transfer**: Technical skills learned in Auxiliaries transfer to civilian economy
- **Network**: Veterans' organizations connect former Auxiliaries across Republic
- **Pride**: Auxiliary service highly respected in home systems

### Integration and Training

**Joint Training**:
- Auxiliaries train with parent Legion minimum 6 months per year
- Participate in all major exercises and war games
- Share barracks and facilities (fosters relationships)
- Cross-training: Legion marines learn Auxiliary specialties, Auxiliaries learn standard Legion tactics

**Cultural Exchange**:
- Auxiliaries teach Legionaries about home world culture
- Legionaries introduce Auxiliaries to federal culture
- Reduces prejudice and builds mutual respect
- Creates informal networks across Republic

**Command Integration**:
- Auxiliary officers attend federal military schools
- Senior Auxiliary commanders serve on Legion staff
- Legion officers assigned as liaison to Auxiliary units
- Clear chain of command: Auxiliary commanders execute orders but have tactical autonomy within their specialty

**Language**:
- Federal Standard (English) is command language
- Auxiliaries must be fluent (requirement for service)
- But Auxiliaries speak home languages among themselves (diversity accepted)
- Multilingual capability is asset in civil affairs and intelligence

### Challenges and Tensions

**Equipment Standardization**:
- Auxiliaries often want to use home-world equipment (familiar, sometimes better for specialty)
- Legion logistics prefer federal standard equipment (easier to supply)
- Solution: Allow specialized equipment for primary role, federal standard for secondary equipment

**Casualty Sensitivity**:
- Home systems politically sensitive to Auxiliary casualties
- Systems may restrict Auxiliary deployment in high-risk operations
- Causes tension: Are Auxiliaries full partners or protected assets?
- Resolution varies by system and Legion

**Identity Conflicts**:
- Auxiliaries maintain home system loyalty and identity
- Can create divided loyalties during political disputes
- Rare but serious: What if home system and federal government disagree?
- Mitigated through: careful selection, strong Legion integration, shared values

**Career Limitations**:
- Auxiliaries cannot command Legions (only Legionaries can be Legate)
- Can command Auxiliary units and serve on staffs, but ceiling exists
- Can transition to full Legionary status after 25 years, removing limitation
- Some Auxiliaries resent this; most accept it
