# Shield Doctrine: Hard Constraints

**Status:** Canonical worldbuilding reference
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27
**Aligns with:** The Stellar Republic worldbuilding

This document defines the unchangeable rules of the Shield Doctrine universe—physical laws, technology limits, and deliberately mysterious elements that should remain consistent across all stories.

## Physics & Technology Hard Limits

### Faster-Than-Light Travel

- Jump drives only (spatial compression, not wormholes)
- Requires massive energy (scales exponentially with distance)
- Calculation time vs. accuracy trade-off fundamental
- Cannot jump near massive gravitational sources safely
- **No FTL communication possible** (physics constraint, cannot ever be developed)

### Phase-Variance Shields

- Duration limited by power and psychological factors
- **Cannot communicate electronically while phased**
- Objects must be in physical contact to remain phased together
- Phased objects cannot interact with normal matter
- Possible exotic energy signature (unexploited vulnerability)
- Psychological strain increases with duration

### Warp Corridors

- Require anchors at both endpoints
- Anchors must be pre-aligned (cannot be programmed on-the-fly)
- Carrier positioning critical (gravitational constraints)
- Binary success/failure (no gradual degradation)
- Cannot create corridors larger than 3m diameter (current tech)
- Power consumption scales with distance

### Energy and Power

- Cannot create energy from nothing
- Reactors have physical limits
- Batteries/capacitors have energy density limits
- Phase-shields scale badly with mass (exponential power requirements)
- Capital ships too massive to phase with current technology

### Technology Rules

- No artificial gravity (spin gravity only)
- No force fields/shields (except phase-variance, which is different)
- No energy weapons breaking thermodynamics
- **No FTL communication ever** (physics constraint)
- No uploading consciousness or true AI (narrow AI only)
- No casual time travel or time manipulation

## Human Limitations

### Biological Constraints

- Humans remain baseline biology (no genetic engineering creating supermen)
- Cybernetic enhancement possible but limited (augmentation has trade-offs)
- Life extension mentioned but not detailed (avoid specifics for now)
- Phase tolerance is individual variation, not trainable beyond adaptation
- Physical and psychological limits remain human-scale
- Medical science advanced but not magical

### Cognitive Constraints

- No telepathy or psi powers
- Decision-making still human-speed (enhanced by computers but fundamentally limited)
- Span of control remains ~5-7 direct reports regardless of technology
- Learning takes time (no skill downloads)
- Expertise requires years of development

## Mysterious Elements (Deliberately Unexplained)

### The Artifact

**What's Known:**

- Found on barren planet orbiting Obsidian Station
- ~10cm across, geometric patterns
- Manufactured by someone/something (not natural)
- Inspired phase-variance shield breakthrough
- Quantum resonance patterns suggest spacetime manipulation
- Mathematical connections to jump drives and warp corridors
- Deeper patterns visible but not yet understood

**What's Unknown (Deliberately):**

- Who created it? When? Why?
- Is it alien or ancient human?
- Are there more artifacts?
- What are its full capabilities?
- Is it related to larger galactic mysteries?
- Was it left deliberately or lost accidentally?

**Rules:**

- Origin remains mysterious (no easy answers)
- Capabilities partially understood (phase-variance) but depths unknown
- Connection to larger universe mysteries
- Adeyemi continues studying (ongoing research)
- Future stories will explore but not immediately resolve

### Jump Drive Origins

**What's Known:**

- Technology exists in multiple stellar nations
- The Republic reverse-engineered from captured vessels
- Could be: Invented, discovered from precursors, stolen from someone else
- Other stellar nations possess it
- Origins unclear and contested

**What's Unknown (Deliberately):**

- Who invented it originally?
- Discovered from ancient civilization?
- Acquired from another stellar nation?
- Related to artifacts?
- How widespread is the technology?

**Rules:**

- Origin never casually revealed (major mystery)
- Multiple theories exist in-universe (none confirmed)
- Suggests larger galactic history
- Future stories may explore

## Flexible Elements (What Can Vary Between Stories)

### Other Stellar Nations

**Mentioned but Undeveloped:**

- Multiple human stellar nations exist
- Various governance systems
- Some democratic, some authoritarian, some other
- Trade relationships, diplomatic contacts
- Potential allies, rivals, or enemies

**Development Freedom:**

- Create new nations as needed for stories
- Various sizes and capabilities
- Different cultural approaches
- Different technology levels
- Some may have jump drives, others not

**Guidelines:**

- The Republic is one among many (not dominant power)
- Diverse human political evolution across diaspora
- Room for interesting contrasts and comparisons
- No monolithic "human government"
- Each nation has distinct identity

### Alien Species

**What's Established:**

- No alien species definitively encountered in trilogy
- Genuine alien life may exist (galactic core mysteries)
- No other alien contacts mentioned
- Contact rare but not impossible

**Development Freedom:**

- Can introduce new alien species in future stories
- Truly alien biology and psychology possible
- Contact rare but not impossible
- No Star Trek style dozens of humanoid aliens
- Keep encounters meaningful, not routine

**Guidelines:**

- Aliens should be genuinely alien (not humans with makeup)
- Rare encounters maintain impact
- Biology and psychology that differs from humans
- Communication challenges
- Cultural differences more than superficial

### Historical Conflicts

**Mentioned but Not Detailed:**

- Frontier Wars (Stone's background)
- Various member world conflicts before joining
- Pirate/raider problems on frontier
- Trade disputes between nations

**Development Freedom:**

- Create historical conflicts as needed
- Various scales (skirmishes to wars)
- Different opponents and circumstances
- Character backstories can reference them
- Build universe history organically

**Guidelines:**

- Republic history is relatively peaceful (defensive posture)
- Most conflicts defensive or peacekeeping
- No massive wars of conquest (against Republic values)
- Victory through professional competence
- Some conflicts unsuccessful (realistic)

### Member World Details

**Established:**

- 47 member systems at trilogy start
- New Terra (capital), Mars (training hub) detailed
- Others mentioned but not described

**Development Freedom:**

- Create member worlds as needed for stories
- Various environments, cultures, specializations
- Different integration timelines
- Unique contributions to the Republic
- Local politics and culture

**Guidelines:**

- Each world has distinct identity
- Integration is process, not instant
- Some worlds more integrated than others
- Frontier vs. Core distinction
- All joined voluntarily

### Life Extension Technology

**Mentioned but Not Detailed:**

- Some life extension possible
- Tiered by citizenship status (mentioned but not explained)
- Not central to current stories
- Deliberately vague

**Development Freedom:**

- Can develop specifics when needed for story
- Various technologies possible (medical, biological, other)
- Social implications can be explored
- Limits and trade-offs necessary

**Guidelines:**

- No immortality (death still eventual)
- Not magical or perfect
- Has social and political implications
- Expensive or requires earned access
- Complications and side effects realistic

## Continuity Management

**When Introducing New Elements:**

1. Check existing canon - Does it contradict established facts?
2. Consider implications - How does it affect established elements?
3. Document clearly - Add to consistency guide for future reference
4. Inform collaborators - If multiple writers, share information

**When Contradictions Arise:**

1. Evaluate priority - Which version better serves universe?
2. Retcon carefully - Only if necessary and done well
3. Document change - Update consistency guide
4. Maintain tone - Don't let corrections feel jarring

**Living Document:**

- This guide will expand as universe develops
- New canonical elements get added
- Flexible elements can be refined into canon
- Contradictions resolved through discussion

## Technology Development Principles

**Hard Limits (Cannot Change):**

- Physics constraints are absolute
- No FTL communication ever
- Jump drives require massive energy
- Phase-shields cannot work on capital ships (current era)
- Humans remain baseline biology

**Innovation Guidelines:**

- Technology advances slowly and systematically
- Phase-shields are revolution (once per generation)
- Most improvements incremental
- 50 years between major breakthroughs typical
- All technology has limitations and trade-offs

**Testing and Refinement:**

- New technology requires systematic development
- Failures before successes
- Institutional adoption takes time
- No instant solutions
- Manufacturing and logistics constrain deployment
