## Branch 6: Vigiles Service

### Motto and Cultural Identity

**Motto**: "Ever Vigilant, Ever Ready" (*Vigiles Semper Parati*)

**Cultural Identity**:
The Vigiles Service sees itself as the Republic's "everyday heroes"—the first responders who stand between chaos and order, danger and safety. While Stellar Legions defend the Republic from external threats, Vigiles protect citizens from fires, crimes, accidents, and disasters. They are the ones who show up when you call for help, who run toward danger while others flee, who work nights and weekends keeping communities safe. They are closest to civilians, most visible in daily life, and most directly save lives.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Ever vigilant**: Constant readiness, always watching, never off duty in spirit
