# The Stellar Republic - Citizenship

## Document Summary

This document details the Republic's innovative tiered citizenship system, which is its greatest innovation and primary integration tool. Unlike binary citizen/non-citizen systems, the Republic offers four distinct tiers with clear advancement paths, meaningful distinctions, and genuine choice.

**The Four Citizenship Tiers:**
- **Non-Citizens** (~30%): Legal protections and economic rights, but no voting; can pursue citizenship
- **Junior Residents** (~15%): Children of citizens, ages 0-20, inherit parent privileges, must choose service at age 20
- **Resident Citizens** (~35%): Completed 8 years service, vote in local elections, most practical benefits
- **Full Citizens** (~20%): 10-12 years service + challenging examination, vote in all elections, hold any office

**Key Features:**
- Service requirement creates stakeholders invested in society's success
- Multiple tiers acknowledge different levels of commitment and contribution
- Clear pathways and genuine choice (not coercive)
- System-level citizenship mirrors individual citizenship (Associate → Full Member)
- Citizenship can be lost through criminal actions or failure to meet obligations
- Ongoing political debate between Universalists, Traditionalists, and Reformists

**Core Philosophy:** Citizenship must be earned to be valued. Service creates stakeholders with genuine investment in the common good.

## PART II: TIERED CITIZENSHIP SYSTEM

The Republic's citizenship model is its greatest innovation and primary integration tool. Unlike binary citizen/non-citizen systems, the Republic offers multiple tiers with clear advancement paths, meaningful distinctions, and genuine choice.

### The Citizenship Tiers

**1. NON-CITIZENS** (~30% of population)

**Status**: Individuals who have not completed service or chosen to pursue citizenship paths. This includes:
- Children under age 20 (born to non-citizen parents)
- Immigrants from other factions who haven't begun service
- Those who choose not to pursue citizenship
- Temporary residents and visitors
- Those who failed service or lost citizenship

**Rights**:
- Legal protections: due process, habeas corpus, prohibition on torture
- Economic rights: own property, form contracts, conduct business
- Freedom of movement within Republic space
- Access to public education (through age 18)
- Access to emergency services and basic medical care
- Protection under Stellar Law of Peoples

**Limitations**:
- Cannot vote in any elections
- Cannot hold public office
- Cannot serve in Stellar Legions (can serve in system militias with limited roles)
- Cannot own starships without special license
- Pay higher taxes (15% vs 10% for Resident Citizens)
- Limited access to advanced educational institutions
- Cannot sponsor family immigration without meeting wealth requirements
- Not eligible for federal economic assistance programs

**Pathways Forward**:
- Apply for Junior Resident status at age 20 (if born in Republic)
- Apply for Resident status from outside (requires 2 years residency plus recommendation)
- Accumulate wealth/skills and apply for expedited Resident status

**Why People Choose Non-Citizenship**:
- Some value autonomy over political participation
- Certain professions (artists, merchants, scholars) don't require citizenship
- Short-term residents don't want long-term commitment
- Ideological opposition to service requirements
- Physical or psychological inability to complete service

The Republic explicitly does not discriminate against non-citizens in daily life. Businesses, housing, social opportunities remain open. However, political power and certain careers remain gated.

**2. JUNIOR RESIDENTS** (~15% of population)

**Status**: Children of Full or Resident Citizens, ages 0-20. Intermediate status recognizing family connection while requiring individual demonstration of commitment.

**Rights** (inherit from parents' citizenship):
- All non-citizen rights plus:
- Reduced tax rate (12%)
- Access to Federal Academy preparatory schools
- Can own personal vehicles and spacecraft (under parental sponsorship until age 18)
- Priority in university admissions
- Eligible for educational grants and scholarships
- Protected status (Republic obligated to defend/rescue)

**Limitations**:
- No voting rights (even at age 18-20)
- Cannot hold office
- Cannot serve in most government positions
- Must complete service to become Resident or Full Citizen at age 20+

**The Age 20 Choice**:

When Junior Residents turn 20, they must choose:

**Option A: Begin Service Path**
- Commit to 8 years of service (age 20-28) in chosen branch
- Automatically become Resident Citizen upon completion
- Can pursue Full Citizenship immediately after or later

**Option B: Decline Service**
- Become Non-Citizen at age 20
- Lose Junior Resident privileges
- Can apply for service later but face more stringent requirements
- Many who decline later regret missing the "traditional" path

**Option C: Delay Decision**
- Can extend Junior Resident status for up to 5 additional years (until age 25)
- Must be enrolled in advanced education or have documented medical/family reasons
- After age 25, must choose Option A or B

Statistics show ~75% choose Option A, ~5% choose Option B immediately, ~20% delay. Of those who delay, ~60% eventually complete service.

**3. RESIDENT CITIZENS** (~35% of population)

**Status**: Individuals who have completed basic service requirement (8 years) but not Full Citizenship service or examination. This is the most common citizenship tier.

**Rights**:
- All Junior Resident rights plus:
- **Vote in local elections** (city, planet, station governance)
- **Vote in system referendums** on constitutional amendments and major policy
- Hold local office (city council, municipal magistrate, local administrative positions)
- Full tax benefits (10% standard rate)
- **Priority in crisis situations** (evacuation, rescue, resource allocation)
- Full access to all federal educational institutions
- Unrestricted travel and business licensing
- Can sponsor immediate family for immigration (spouse, children, parents)
- Eligible for veterans' benefits and land grants
- Protected by Federal Legions with full commitment

**Limitations**:
- **Cannot vote for System Senate or Federal Senate**
- Cannot hold system-level or federal office
- Cannot serve in Stellar Legions or federal government (except technical/support roles)
- Cannot vote in system consul elections
- Limited voting rights in emergency war declarations (advisory but not binding)

**Service Requirement** (8 years, ages 20-28 typical):

Resident Citizenship requires completing 8 years in one of five branches:
- Engineering Corps
- Medical Service
- Scientific Expedition
- Civic Administration
- Stellar Legion Auxiliary/Support

Service must be completed with at least "Satisfactory" ratings. "Exemplary" service can reduce requirement to 6 years. Serious discipline problems can extend or disqualify.

**Why Most People Stop Here**:
- Resident status provides most practical benefits
- Full Citizenship requires additional 2+ years service and challenging examination
- Many don't want political careers and see Full Citizenship as unnecessary
- Eight years of service is significant life commitment; many want to start families/careers
- Full Citizenship examination has ~40% failure rate, discouraging some

**Resident Citizens represent the backbone** of Republic society: skilled professionals, small business owners, engineers, teachers, medical personnel, local administrators. They have stake in system through voting rights and service but aren't pursuing political careers.

**4. FULL CITIZENS** (~20% of population)

**Status**: Individuals who completed extended service (10-12 years total) and passed rigorous Full Citizenship Examination. This tier represents the political class and federal officials.

**Rights**:
- All Resident Citizen rights plus:
- **Vote in all elections** (local, system, federal)
- **Hold any office** (system senate, federal positions, consul)
- **Serve in Stellar Legions** as officers or enlisted
- Priority consideration for federal appointments
- Can sponsor extended family (siblings, grandparents, cousins)
- Lifetime guarantees of basic income in retirement
- Access to classified information relevant to office held
- **Full protection under Federal Charter** (Federal Senate must authorize any action against Full Citizen)

**Service Requirement**:

Beyond 8-year Resident requirement, Full Citizenship demands additional service:

**Option 1: Extended Branch Service** (Total 12 years)
- Complete 8 years for Resident status in any branch
- Serve additional 4 years in positions of increased responsibility
- Receive "Exemplary" rating in both periods

**Option 2: Officer Track** (Total 10 years)
- Complete 4 years Federal Academy (intensive education ages 18-22)
- Serve 6 years in officer roles in chosen branch
- Receive "Exemplary" rating

**Option 3: Exceptional Contribution** (Variable)
- Demonstrate extraordinary achievement in science, engineering, arts, or public service
- Receive nomination from System Senate or Federal officials
- Complete abbreviated service (2-4 years) in areas of expertise
- Pass Enhanced Citizenship Examination

**Plus: The Citizenship Examination**

All Full Citizenship candidates must pass comprehensive examination covering:

**Constitutional Law** (40% of exam):
- Federal Charter provisions and interpretation
- System constitutions and federal relationship
- Historical constitutional development
- Rights and obligations of each citizenship tier
- Landmark judicial decisions

**History and Philosophy** (30% of exam):
- Roman Republic and Empire history
- Founding of Stellar Republic and generation ship era
- Major wars, crises, and triumphs
- Political philosophy (republicanism, citizenship theory, civic virtue)
- Comparative government systems

**Practical Governance** (30% of exam):
- Economic policy and budgeting
- Military strategy and organization
- Infrastructure planning and engineering basics
- Diplomatic protocol and interstellar law
- Crisis management and emergency powers

**Format**: Written examination (12 hours), oral examination before panel of censors (4 hours), practical scenarios (8 hours). Requires 75% overall score to pass. Can retake once after one year.

**Failure Rate**: ~40% fail on first attempt, ~60% of those pass on second attempt. Total failure rate is ~25%.

**Why Pursue Full Citizenship**:
- Political ambition (necessary for high office)
- Military career (officer ranks require it)
- Federal government service
- Cultural prestige (Full Citizens viewed as most committed)
- Family tradition (multi-generational citizenship families)
- Personal conviction about civic duty

**Full Citizens are expected to embody civic virtues**: service, integrity, competence, long-term thinking. Public scandals involving Full Citizens are more damaging than those involving lower tiers—they're held to higher standards.

### Citizenship for Systems and Organizations

**System-Level Citizenship**:

When an independent system petitions to join the Republic, it follows a pathway mirroring individual citizenship:

**Petitioner Status** (Years 0-2):
- System formally requests Republic membership
- Federal delegation conducts assessment (governance, rule of law, human rights, stability)
- System receives preliminary trade agreements and observer status at Federal Senate
- Republic makes no military commitments yet

**Associate System** (Years 3-12):
- If accepted after assessment, system becomes Associate for 10 years
- Implements Republic-compatible governance (republican constitution, citizenship tiers)
- Receives federal investment in infrastructure (communication, trade, defense)
- Can request emergency assistance but not guaranteed
- Sends non-voting observers to Federal Senate
- Citizens of Associate Systems receive Resident-equivalent status automatically

**Trial Period** (Years 10-12):
- Federal delegation conducts comprehensive review
- System Senate votes on whether to request full membership
- Federal Senate votes on whether to accept (requires 2/3 majority)
- If accepted, system becomes Full Member

**Full Member System**:
- Sends 3 senators to Federal Senate (voting members)
- Protected by Federal Legions (full military commitment)
- Contributes ships and personnel to Federal fleet
- Citizens automatically eligible for Full Citizenship (if they meet individual requirements)
- System laws must comply with Federal Charter but retain system autonomy
- Receives federal infrastructure investment

**Why Systems Join**:
- **Military protection**: Federal Legions are formidable; membership means security
- **Economic benefits**: Free trade zone, infrastructure investment, technology exchange
- **Stable governance**: Republican model provides proven framework
- **Prestige**: Republic systems viewed as civilized and advanced
- **Infrastructure**: Federal engineers build roads, communications, defense platforms
- **Legal framework**: Access to Federal courts and Stellar Law of Peoples

**Why Some Systems Decline**:
- Sovereignty concerns (fear federal interference)
- Cultural incompatibility (systems with very different social norms)
- Economic costs (federal taxes and fleet contributions)
- Ideological opposition (monarchies, corporate states, other systems)
- Existing alliances with other factions

**Organizational Citizenship**:

The Republic does NOT grant citizenship to corporations, churches, or other organizations. Only individuals and planetary systems can be citizens. However, organizations can be **Chartered Entities** recognized under Republic law:

**Federal Charter**: Organization registered with federal government, subject to federal regulations, receives legal protections. Requirements:
- Transparent ownership structure
- Compliance with labor laws
- Tax payment
- No engagement in prohibited activities (slavery, piracy, war crimes)

Chartered Entities have legal rights (property, contracts, court access) but no political rights (cannot vote, lobby, or contribute to campaigns). This prevents corporate capture of government.

### Citizenship Obligations

Each citizenship tier comes with obligations, not just rights:

**All Tiers**:
- Obey laws
- Pay taxes
- Truthful testimony in court
- Emergency service (evacuation assistance, disaster response)

**Junior Residents**:
- Attend civic education
- Pass basic competency tests (literacy, mathematics, civics, history)
- Obey parental/guardian authority

**Resident Citizens**:
- Jury service (when called)
- Militia service in home system (reserve obligation, called only for defense)
- Census participation (every 10 years)
- Can be drafted in major existential wars (requires 3/4 Federal Senate vote)

**Full Citizens**:
- All Resident obligations plus:
- Availability for public service (can be conscripted for temporary magistrate positions in emergencies)
- Higher standard of conduct (public scandals can result in citizenship downgrade)
- Defense of Republic (Full Citizens cannot evade military draft in any circumstance)
- Teaching obligation (Full Citizens expected to mentor next generation)

### Losing Citizenship

Citizenship is not permanent. It can be:

**Voluntarily Relinquished**:
- Individual can renounce citizenship and return to non-citizen status
- Requires formal declaration before magistrate
- Cannot reclaim for 5 years
- Few do this (seen as shameful)

**Administratively Downgraded**:
- Failure to meet obligations (tax evasion, refusing jury duty, falsifying records)
- Results in downgrade one tier (Full → Resident → Junior → Non-Citizen)
- Can appeal to praetors
- Can re-qualify after correcting violations

**Criminally Stripped**:
- Serious crimes (treason, war crimes, corruption in office)
- Requires conviction in court with right to defense
- Results in immediate drop to Non-Citizen
- Cannot re-qualify for 10-20 years depending on crime
- Permanent ban for most severe offenses

**Citizenship Loss Statistics**: ~0.5% per year lose or downgrade citizenship. Most common reason is administrative (failure to meet obligations, especially tax payment). Criminal stripping is rare (~0.01% per year).

### The Citizenship Debate

The tiered system generates ongoing political debate:

**Universalists** argue:
- Citizenship should be birthright, not earned
- Service requirements exclude disabled, elderly, those with family obligations
- Creates two-class society (Citizens vs Non-Citizens)
- Limits democratic participation

**Traditionalists** argue:
- Citizenship must be earned to be valued
- Service creates stakeholders with investment in society
- Those who don't contribute shouldn't decide how contributions are spent
- System is flexible (multiple tiers) and open to all who try

**Reformists** argue:
- Current system works but needs refinement
- Consider alternative service paths (caregiving, arts, philosophy)
- Reduce examination difficulty (40% failure rate too high)
- Provide more support for those pursuing citizenship

The Federal Senate periodically revisits citizenship laws, making incremental adjustments while preserving core principle: citizenship through contribution.
