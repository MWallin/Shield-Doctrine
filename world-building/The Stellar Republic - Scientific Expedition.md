## Scientific Expedition

### Motto and Cultural Identity

**Motto**: "Knowledge Lights the Stars"

**Cultural Identity**:
Scientific Expedition sees itself as humanity's scout and long-term investment—the branch that discovers new worlds, characterizes alien environments, advances fundamental knowledge, and ensures the Republic stays at the technological frontier. They are explorers, researchers, and the eyes looking toward tomorrow.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Curiosity is virtue**: The unknown calls us; we must answer
- **Long-term thinking**: Research payoff may take generations; pursue anyway
- **Share knowledge**: What we discover belongs to humanity, not to us

### Criticism

**Expensive with Uncertain Returns**:
- Research funding competes with immediate needs
- Exploration finds mostly empty space
- "Why spend billions on exploration when people need infrastructure?"
- Response: "Long-term investment in knowledge pays dividends for centuries"

**Dangerous**:
- Exploration missions have ~5% fatality rate (higher than other civilian branches)
- Long-duration missions mean years away from home
- Families separated for decades during multi-mission careers
- Response: "Those who dare not explore do not advance"

**Elitist**:
- Science Academy highly selective, favors academically gifted
- "Not everyone can be a scientist"
- Limited opportunities for those without strong STEM aptitude
- Response: "Advancing knowledge requires talent and training"

**Impractical**:
- Some research has no immediate application
- Fundamental research doesn't solve current problems
- "Why study theoretical physics when we need better ships?"
- Response: "Today's theory is tomorrow's technology"

**Slow to Share Military Applications**:
- Debate over whether weapon research should be public
- Some discoveries classified for national security
- Tension between scientific openness and military necessity
- Compromise: Publish after delay or redact sensitive details
