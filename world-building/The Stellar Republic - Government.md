**LEGISLATIVE PROCESS**:

1. **Proposal**: Senator introduces bill in committee
2. **Committee Review**: Committee debates, amends, votes
3. **Floor Debate**: If committee approves, full Senate debates (typically 2-4 weeks)
4. **Senate Vote**: Simple majority passes (except treaties and war declarations requiring 2/3)
5. **Consul Review**: Consuls can veto (rarely used; political cost high)
6. **Override**: Senate can override Consul veto with 2/3 majority
7. **Judicial Review**: Praetors can review if constitutional challenge filed
