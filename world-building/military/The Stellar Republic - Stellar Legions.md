- **Contracted Professionals** (320,000 - 25%): Career military providing continuity
- **Federal Legion Command** (100,000 - 8%): Supreme Commander staff, specialized directorates

**Six Specializations**: Space Combat Operations (30%), Marine Corps (25%), Ground Forces (20%), Support Services (15%), Special Operations (5%), Command/Staff (5%)

**Service Path**: 8 years → Resident Citizenship, 12 years → Full Citizenship path (same for all personnel)

## Stellar Legion Service

### Motto and Cultural Identity

**Motto**: "Shields of the Republic"

**Cultural Identity**:
Stellar Legion Service views itself as the Republic's sword and shield—the branch that protects citizens, defeats threats, maintains order, and projects power when necessary. They are warriors, defenders, and the ultimate guarantors of security. Military service carries the highest prestige and greatest risk.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Defense is sacred duty**: Protection of Republic and citizens above all
- **Discipline saves lives**: Chaos kills; order preserves
- **Combined arms**: Integration of capabilities multiplies effectiveness
- **All serve equally**: Officers and enlisted follow same citizenship path

### Organization and Personnel Structure

The Stellar Legion Service employs a three-tier personnel system balancing passionate warriors with experienced professionals.

#### Total Force: 1,270,000 Personnel

**Enlisted vs Officer Tracks** (both are service members earning citizenship):
- **Enlisted**: Ages 20-28, 6 months basic + 12-18 months specialty training, then 8 years service → Resident Citizenship
- **Officers**: Ages 18-22 at Federal Academy (4 years), then 6 years commissioned service = 10 years total → Resident Citizenship after 8 years of service (Federal Academy counts as first 2 years)
- **Important**: Both tracks need 12 total years for Full Citizenship - officers don't get special treatment
- Officers command (ship captains, cohort commanders, staff), enlisted execute (marines, crew, specialists)

**Contracted Professionals (320,000 - 25%)**:
- Already completed citizenship service (have Resident or Full Citizenship)

### Service Experience

The Stellar Legion Service offers two pathways - enlisted and officer - but both lead to the same citizenship milestones.

#### Enlisted Track (Standard Path)

**Ages 18-20: Recruitment and Basic Training (6 months)**:
- Physical conditioning to extreme levels
- Weapons training (energy rifles, close combat, heavy weapons)
- Small unit tactics
- Space survival and zero-G operations

**Ages 22-28: Active Service (Years 3-8)**:
- Serve in assigned Legion and specialty
- Increasing skill and independence over time
- May become squad leaders, fire team leaders
- Deploy on operations, exercises, peacekeeping
- Years 3-5: Junior enlisted (learning, building competence)
- Years 6-8: Senior enlisted (leading small teams, mentoring new personnel)

**Age 28: Resident Citizenship Achieved (After 8 Years Total)**:
- Automatic upon completing 8 years with satisfactory rating
- Can vote in local/system elections
- Full federal benefits: healthcare, education, veterans' preference
- Decision point: Leave for civilian life, continue as contracted professional (path to Full Citizenship)

#### Officer Track (Federal Academy Path)

**Ages 18-22: Federal Academy (4 Years)**:
- Advanced education in military science, engineering, tactics, strategy
- Physical training and leadership development
- Summer training with active Legions
- Commission as junior officer upon graduation (O-1, Ensign/Lieutenant)
- Counts as first 4 years of service

**Ages 22-28: Commissioned Service (6 Years Active Duty)**:
- Serve as platoon/century leaders (O-1, O-2)
- Company/cohort commanders (O-3)
- Staff positions in Legion headquarters
- Advanced military education and training
- Rotate through different specialties and assignments

**Age 28: Resident Citizenship Achieved (After 8 Years Total Service)**:
- Federal Academy (4 years) + Active Duty (6 years) = 10 years total, but citizenship after 8 years of service
- Same citizenship as enlisted track - NO special privileges
- Decision point: Leave for civilian life, continue as career officer (path to Full Citizenship)

#### Important Notes on Officer/Enlisted Equality

**Same Citizenship Pathway**:
- Enlisted: 8 years service → Resident Citizenship, 12 years → Full Citizenship
- Officers: 8 years service → Resident Citizenship, 12 years → Full Citizenship
- Officers do NOT get faster citizenship despite Federal Academy education

**Why Officers Exist**:
- Ships need captains with advanced training
- Large formations need strategic commanders
- Complex operations require sophisticated planning
- Federal Academy provides this education

**Why No Special Citizenship for Officers**:
- Republic values all service equally
- Officers already benefit from Federal Academy education (free, prestigious)
- Preventing officer aristocracy and maintaining republican equality
- Officers serve alongside enlisted, share risks, earn same citizenship
