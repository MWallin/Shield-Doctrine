- Role: Fleet command, heavy firepower, Legion flagship

**Armament**:
- 8x Heavy particle beam cannons (anti-capital ship)
- 40x Medium energy turrets (anti-cruiser)
- 100x Point defense lasers (anti-fighter/missile)
- 200x Missile tubes (various warheads)
- 4x Fighter/bomber squadrons (80 craft)

**Defense**:
- Heavy composite armor (carbon-metal matrix)

---

**BOMBER** (Carried by capital ships and carriers)

**Specifications**:
- Length: 20 meters
- Crew: 2 (pilot and weapons officer)
- Role: Anti-ship strike

**Armament**:
- 1x Light energy cannon (self-defense)

**Performance**:
- Moderate agility (7-8G)
- Top speed: 55% light speed
- Range: 750,000 km from carrier (longer than interceptors, carries more fuel)

**Doctrine**: Bombers deliver heavy ordnance against enemy capital ships. They penetrate defenses (escorted by interceptors) and launch missiles/torpedoes, then retreat. Vulnerable to enemy fighters so must be protected.

---

**ASSAULT POD** (Carried by assault carriers)

**Specifications**:
- Length: 8 meters
- Crew: 10 marines + 2 pilots
- Role: Boarding enemy ships, assault on stations

**Armament**:
- Breaching charges (cut through hulls)

**Performance**:
- Fast (9G acceleration for short burst)
- Short range (50,000 km maximum)
- One-way trip (no return fuel)

**Doctrine**: Assault pods deliver marines directly to enemy ships/stations during boarding actions. Dozens launch simultaneously to overwhelm point defenses. Very dangerous (30-50% casualty rate in hot assaults) but effective way to capture instead of destroying enemy assets.

---

**DROPSHIP** (Carried by assault carriers)

**Specifications**:

**System Yards** (present in all 42 member systems):
- Build civilian ships and small warships (frigates, corvettes)
- Perform maintenance and repairs
- Additional production: ~200 small ships per year

**Technology Level**:
- Current ships are 2nd generation (post-reunification designs)
- Continuous improvement in weapons, shields, propulsion
- Next generation (3rd gen) under development: faster, better weapons, improved electronics
- Technology shared among Legions but classified from other factions

**Ship Lifespan**:
- 40-60 years typical service life
- Extensive refits every 10 years
- Older ships relegated to reserves or training duty
- Some ships serve 100+ years if well-maintained (becomes legendary)
