## 1. Tone and Genre Requirements

### Noblebright Requirements

- Protagonists are genuinely good people
- The Republic is trying to do good (not perfect, but trying)
- Good systems can be built by good people
- Competent people solving hard problems
- Optimistic without being naive
- Costs and sacrifices acknowledged but worthwhile

### Military SF Requirements

- Professional competence emphasized
- Tactics and strategy matter
- Technology has limitations
- Training and preparation pay off
- Logistics and supply are real constraints
- Victory through skill, not luck

### Rules

- No grimdark cynicism (optimistic realism)
- No stupid characters making arbitrary mistakes
- No technology solving everything magically
- No individualist hero worship (team/system focus)
- Failures happen due to genuine difficulty, not incompetence

---

## 2. Character Conventions

### Competence

- Characters are good at their jobs
- Mistakes come from genuine difficulty, not stupidity
- Learning and adaptation through experience
- Professional standards maintained

### Relationships

- Professional respect dominates over drama
- Personal relationships exist but not soap opera
- Conflicts are genuine disagreements, not petty
- Romance possible but not required or central

### Development

- Characters grow through experience
- Earned progression (no sudden transformations)
- Victories and failures shape them
- Multiple characters significant (not single protagonist)

### Rules

- No incompetent professionals
- No arbitrary personality changes
- No relationship drama overwhelming plot
- Professional excellence is attractive (no artificial conflict)

## 3. Combat Conventions

### Realism Requirements

- Casualties happen
- Wounds matter
- Fear and exhaustion are real
- Training and preparation essential
- Plans go wrong frequently

### Depiction Standards

- Violence has consequences
- Deaths are meaningful
- Survivors process trauma
- Medical care detailed
- Heroism without invulnerability

### Rules

- No invincible protagonists
- No casual violence without consequences
- No miraculous recoveries
- Professional soldiers, not action heroes
- Victory costs something

---

## 4. Technology Depiction

### Consistency

- Capabilities and limitations defined
- No magic technology
- Problems require solutions, not new tech appearing
- Manufacturing and logistics matter
- Old technologies remain useful

### Innovation

- New technology developed systematically
- Testing and refinement shown
- Failures before successes
- Institutional adoption takes time
- No instant solutions

### Rules

- Technology follows established physics
- New capabilities must fit existing framework
- Cannot introduce wildly different tech suddenly
- Evolution, not revolution (except phase-shields, which is trilogy's unique revolution)

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technology Creep

- Don't casually introduce new capabilities without justification
- Don't solve problems with previously unmentioned tech
- Don't forget limitations established earlier
- Don't make technology too reliable (failures happen)

### Character Inflation

- Don't make everyone exceptional (most are merely competent)
- Don't forget physical and psychological limits
- Don't resolve conflicts too easily
- Don't ignore previous characterization

### Scale Inconsistency

- Don't casually mention thousands of ships when hundreds established
- Don't forget manufacturing constraints
- Don't make training faster than established
- Don't ignore logistics requirements

### Tone Violations

- Don't make good guys do bad things without consequences
- Don't make enemies stupid (professional opponents)
- Don't cynicism-creep into grimdark
- Don't forget costs of violence and war

### Roman Inspiration Issues

- Don't force awkward parallels (organic integration only)
- Don't copy-paste Roman details unchanged
- Don't lose modern military SF feel
- Don't make it historical recreation
