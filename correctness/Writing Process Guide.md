# Pre-Writing Checklist

Before starting any new Shield Doctrine story, work through this checklist to ensure consistency and avoid common pitfalls.

## 1. Timeline Verification

- When does story occur relative to trilogy?
- What technologies exist at that time?
- Which characters are available/appropriate age?
- What historical events have occurred?

## 2. Technology Audit

- What tech appears in story?
- Capabilities and limitations consistent?
- Power requirements addressed?
- Manufacturing and logistics considered?

## 3. Character Consistency

- Ages appropriate for timeline?
- Ranks/positions match experience?
- Personality consistent with previous appearances?
- Development logical given events?

## 4. Political Context

- Republic governance structure respected?
- Member world count appropriate?
- Citizenship system properly depicted?
- Values system referenced correctly?

## 5. Military Details

- Unit organization correct?
- Tactics consistent with doctrine?
- Equipment properly used?
- Logistics addressed?

## 6. Tone Check

- Noblebright maintained?
- Professional competence emphasized?
- Optimistic without naivete?
- Costs and sacrifices shown?

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

## Technology Creep

- Don't casually introduce new capabilities without justification
- Don't solve problems with previously unmentioned tech
- Don't forget limitations established earlier
- Don't make technology too reliable (failures happen)

## Character Inflation

- Don't make everyone exceptional (most are merely competent)
- Don't forget physical and psychological limits
- Don't resolve conflicts too easily
- Don't ignore previous characterization

## Scale Inconsistency

- Don't casually mention thousands of ships when hundreds established
- Don't forget manufacturing constraints
- Don't make training faster than established
- Don't ignore logistics requirements

## Tone Violations

- Don't make good guys do bad things without consequences
- Don't make enemies stupid (professional opponents)
- Don't cynicism-creep into grimdark
- Don't forget costs of violence and war

## Roman Inspiration Issues

- Don't force awkward parallels (organic integration only)
- Don't copy-paste Roman details unchanged
- Don't lose modern military SF feel
- Don't make it historical recreation

# Continuity Management

## When Introducing New Elements

1. **Check existing canon** - Does it contradict established facts?
2. **Consider implications** - How does it affect established elements?
3. **Document clearly** - Add to consistency guide for future reference
4. **Inform collaborators** - If multiple writers, share information

## When Contradictions Arise

1. **Evaluate priority** - Which version better serves universe?
2. **Retcon carefully** - Only if necessary and done well
3. **Document change** - Update consistency guide
4. **Maintain tone** - Don't let corrections feel jarring

## Living Document

- The consistency guide will expand as universe develops
- New canonical elements get added
- Flexible elements can be refined into canon
- Contradictions resolved through discussion

# Collaborative Guidelines

## For Multiple Authors

### Core Canon (Cannot Change)

- Timeline anchors
- Technological limitations
- Republic political structure
- Citizenship system
- Core characters' established traits
- Major trilogy events

### Flexible Canon (Discuss Before Changing)

- Minor character details
- New technology developments
- Member world specifics
- Historical event details
- Cultural practices

### Free Development

- New characters
- New member worlds
- New conflicts
- New aliens (rare)
- New stellar nations
- Side stories

### Communication

- Share outlines before writing
- Coordinate character usage
- Discuss technology innovations
- Resolve contradictions collaboratively
- Update consistency guide together

## For Media Adaptations

### Non-Negotiable

- Core values and themes
- Noblebright tone
- Professional competence emphasis
- Roman-inspired structure
- Technology limitations

### Adaptable

- Visual designs (ships, uniforms, etc.)
- Specific scene details
- Pacing and structure
- Minor character consolidation
- Some timeline compression

### Requires Discussion

- Major plot changes
- Character personality shifts
- Technology capability changes
- Political structure alterations
- Tone modifications

# Common Process Questions

## Technology Development Questions

**Q: How fast does technology advance?**

A: Slowly and systematically. Phase-shields are revolution (once per generation), most improvements incremental. 50 years between major breakthroughs typical.

## Character Questions

**Q: Can main trilogy characters appear in other stories?**

A: Yes, with caveats. Respect established characterization. Age them appropriately. Don't overuse (let new characters shine). Get age/rank/position correct for timeline.

**Q: Can characters die in expanded universe stories?**

A: Side characters yes. Main characters (Chen, Varro, Torres, etc.) only if absolutely necessary for story and done respectfully. Death must be meaningful, not casual.

**Q: Can characters change significantly?**

A: Through experience and time, yes. But changes must be earned through events, not arbitrary. Professional competence remains regardless. Core personality traits stable.

**Q: Can new protagonists be better than trilogy characters?**

A: Different, not necessarily better. Chen is exceptional but not superhuman. New characters can have different strengths. Competence comes in many forms.

## Military Questions

**Q: Can legion structure change?**

A: Minor variations acceptable (specialized legions with different compositions) but core cohort-century-contubernium structure is fundamental. Don't abandon what works.

**Q: Can other branches besides boarding specialists use phase-shields?**

A: Yes. Intelligence operations, reconnaissance, special forces all make sense. But boarding specialists remain primary users (that's their specialized role).

**Q: Can Shield Doctrine be countered?**

A: Yes, and should be eventually. No doctrine remains dominant forever. Future stories about adaptation and counter-adaptation encouraged.

**Q: Can auxiliary forces become as important as legions?**

A: Yes. Specialized capabilities can be crucial. But legions remain backbone. Balance between legion core and auxiliary specialists.

## Story Questions

**Q: Can stories be darker/grittier than trilogy?**

A: Within limits. Can show costs, casualties, difficult decisions. Cannot abandon noblebright tone or make Republic fundamentally corrupt. Dark moments within optimistic framework.

**Q: Can stories focus on non-military characters?**

A: Absolutely encouraged. Civilian scientists, engineers, administrators, civilians on member worlds all valid protagonists. Universe is bigger than military.

**Q: Can stories show the Republic making mistakes?**

A: Yes. Mistakes, failures, unintended consequences all realistic. Key: Learning from mistakes and improving. Not perfect, but trying to do better.

**Q: Can stories show other nations as positive?**

A: Yes. The Republic is one good system among possible good systems. Other approaches can work. Different doesn't mean wrong. Diversity of human political evolution encouraged.

**Remember:** These guidelines exist to maintain consistency, not to constrain creativity. When in doubt about whether something fits, ask: "Does this serve the story while respecting what's been established?" If yes, proceed. If no, revise or discuss with collaborators.
