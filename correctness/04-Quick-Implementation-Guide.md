# Quick Implementation Guide: Aligning Story v7 with Stellar Republic

**Purpose**: Step-by-step checklist for revising the story to match Stellar Republic worldbuilding.

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20 (reviewed against Act I v7)

**Current Scope**: Act I v7 (~10,465 words), Acts II-III v5

---

## PHASE 1: SIMPLE FIND-REPLACE CHANGES

**v7 Impact Estimates:**
- **"Confederation"**: ~200+ instances in Act I v7 alone
- **"Krell"**: ~100+ instances in Act I v7 alone
- Acts II-III v5 have additional instances

### Terminology Changes:

```
FIND: "Confederation"
REPLACE: "Republic" or "Stellar Republic"

EXAMPLES:
- "Confederation space" → "Republic space"
- "Confederation Command" → "Republic Command"
- "Confederation military" → "Republic military"
- "Confederation Legionaries" → "Republic Legionaries"

v7 INSTANCES (Act I):
- Line 239: "Commander Sarah Varro had served fifteen years in the Confederation military"
- Line 273: "From Resolute: Varro, Torres, and six shuttle pilots"
- Throughout investigation scenes
- ~200+ total in Act I v7
```

```
FIND: "Krell"
REPLACE: "Meridian Empire" or "Meridian"

EXAMPLES:
- "Krell Hegemony" → "Meridian Empire"
- "Krell ships" → "Meridian ships"
- "Krell attack" → "Meridian attack"
- "Krell security teams" → "Meridian security teams"

v7 INSTANCES (Act I):
- Investigation: Webb leaked coordinates to Krell
- Combat: Krell assault on Obsidian Station
- Throughout escape sequence
- ~100+ total in Act I v7

NOTE: Decide whether to:
- Replace all with "Meridian Empire"
- Keep "Krell" as Stellar Republic faction name
- Make "Krell" alternate name for Meridian
```

**Note**: Keep "Krell" if referring to technology (e.g., "reverse-engineered from Krell technology" can become "reverse-engineered from captured Meridian technology")

---

## PHASE 2: CITIZENSHIP SYSTEM ALIGNMENT

### Current Problem:
Story treats citizenship as binary and introduces three-tier reform.

**v7 Status**: UNRESOLVED. Act I v7 expanded investigation scenes but didn't fix citizenship contradiction. Webb's motivation and "Aurelius" handler network still rely on flawed premise.

### Solution:
Republic already has tiered citizenship. Must adjust Webb's motivation and reform subplot.

**Recommended Approach (see document 02 for details):**
Replace citizenship-based motivation with Artifact Network investigation (Option 1)

### Specific Changes:

**Webb's Status (Act I v7 & Acts II-III):**

CURRENT (v7):
> Webb served nine years in civilian research roles and felt excluded from citizenship. Recruited by handler "Aurelius" who exploited this resentment. Part of underground democratic movement. Democracy vs Republic debate during interrogation.

PROBLEM:
> Under Stellar Republic law, Webb would have Resident Citizenship after 8 years. He's not "excluded"—he has local voting rights and most civic benefits. Only 1-3 years from Full Citizenship.

RECOMMENDED FIX (Option 1 - Artifact Network):
> Webb served nine years in civilian research giving him Resident Citizenship. But handler "Aurelius" recruited him for specific reason: access to Adeyemi's artifact research. "Aurelius" is Kelar agent (or intermediary) tracking precursor technology across Republic. Webb radicalized through manipulation, believing artifact research should be shared. Miller killed when she discovered Webb reporting artifact details, not general research data.

**The Reform Subplot (Act II, Week 26):**

OPTION A - Remove entirely, replace with Artifact Network investigation (see document 02)

OPTION B - Modify to be about examination reform:

BEFORE (v5):
> The Three-Tier Citizenship Proposal:
> - 2 years → Civic Participant (local voting)
> - 4 years → Regional Citizen (sector voting)
> - 6 years → Federal Citizen (full rights)

AFTER (aligned):
> The Citizenship Examination Reform Proposal:
> - Problem: The Full Citizenship examination has a 40% failure rate, creating a class of long-serving Resident Citizens who feel excluded
> - Webb had Resident Citizenship but failed the examination twice
> - Proposal: Create alternative pathways to Full Citizenship for exceptional technical contributors
> - Or: Reduce examination difficulty while maintaining standards
> - Or: Provide more support/preparation for examination candidates

**Senate Debate Focus:**

BEFORE: "How do we prevent resentful non-citizens from becoming security vulnerabilities?"

AFTER: "How do we prevent resentful Resident Citizens who failed the examination from becoming security vulnerabilities while maintaining Full Citizenship standards?"

---

## PHASE 3: TIMELINE AND HISTORICAL REFERENCES

### Add Year References:

Place story in **2746** (4 years before Stellar Republic's present day of 2750).

**Add to Act I opening:**
> Obsidian Station orbits a barren planet in the Frontier Sector [ADD: , the cutting edge of Republic expansion 146 years after the founding of the Federal Republic].

**"First Generation" Clarification:**

FIND references to "First Generation legionaries"

ADD CONTEXT:
> The First Generation—the first cohorts of Federal Legionaries organized after the Congress of Proxima 140 years ago—established boarding doctrine in the early federal period.

**Chen's Grandfather:**

BEFORE (implied):
> Chen's grandfather served in the First Generation

AFTER (clarified):
> Chen's grandfather served during the Liberation Campaigns sixty years ago, when the Republic first projected power beyond its borders. The gladius at Chen's hip—molecular-edge blade in a ceremonial sheath—belonged to that era of expansion.

### Historical References to Add:

**Mention the Meridian Wars:**
> The Meridian Empire—aggressive authoritarian state that the Republic defeated in the Defensive Wars sixty years ago—has been seeking revenge ever since through espionage and proxy conflicts.

**Reference Federal Founding:**
> Since the Federal Charter was ratified 104 years ago at the Congress of Proxima...

**Mention Kelar:**
> The Kelar—silicon-based intelligences humanity first contacted 78 years ago—remain enigmatic despite decades of limited interaction.

---

## PHASE 4: TECHNOLOGY CONTEXT ADJUSTMENTS

### Jump Drives:

**Decision needed**: Does Stellar Republic have jump drives?

OPTION A - YES (recommended for story):
- Add to Stellar Republic: Jump drives developed in 2720s-2730s
- Makes them 15-25 year old technology (mature but not ancient)
- Story's jump drive references work as-is

OPTION B - NO (strict Stellar Republic canon):
- Remove all jump drive references from story
- Change to: "3 weeks subluminal travel" or "8 hours at maximum acceleration"
- Adjust tactical situations for subluminal speeds only

**Recommended**: Option A—add jump drives to Stellar Republic timeline as 2730s breakthrough

### Phase-Shields and Warp Corridors:

**These are fine as-is**: Brand new 2746 breakthroughs
- Phase-shields: Inspired by artifact discovery
- Warp corridors: Experimental technology combining phase-shields with space compression
- No changes needed

### Artifact Origin:

**Already compatible**, just clarify:
> The artifact is one of approximately fifteen similar objects discovered across Republic space over the past 50 years. Until now, they were treated as isolated anomalies—interesting but unexplained geological formations catalogued and filed away. Dr. Adeyemi's breakthrough connects them for the first time.

---

## PHASE 5: INSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES

### Senate Structure:

**Current (v5):**
> The Senate consists of 300 members—all former military commanders at cohort level or higher or civilian administrators who managed equivalent populations.

**Options:**

OPTION A - This is a System Senate:
> The System Senate of [system name] consists of 50 members—all Full Citizens who completed service and reached age 30. The federal structure allows each system to govern internal affairs autonomously.

OPTION B - This is an emergency war council:
> Admiral Stone convened the Federal Senate's Defense Committee via secure transmission—30 senators from nearby systems who could respond quickly, representing the 126-member Federal Senate's delegated authority during military emergencies.

OPTION C - Keep 300 but explain it:
> The Federal Senate consists of 126 senators (42 member systems × 3 senators each). For the Hammerfall authorization, the Senate expanded the session to include 174 military advisors with speaking rights but no votes—former commanders and senior administrators who provided expertise on the Shield Doctrine's readiness.

**Recommended**: Option A or B for accuracy

### Tribunes:

**Current (v5):**
> Tribune Marcus Webb—elected to represent Recent Citizens (those who earned Federal Citizenship in the past five years)—exercises his veto power.

**Clarification needed**: Are Tribunes military ranks or political positions?

In Stellar Republic worldbuilding:
- **Tribune** = Military rank (O-4 to O-5, senior staff officer)
- **Not a political position** in the Roman Tribune of the Plebs sense

**Options:**

OPTION A - Keep political Tribunes, add to worldbuilding:
> Tribunes (the elected representatives of citizens, distinct from military tribunes) serve as advocates ensuring Senate decisions don't harm citizen interests. The system was established after the Federal Charter to provide citizens direct voice in Senate deliberations.

OPTION B - Replace with Censors:
> The Federal Censors—elected officials who maintain citizenship rolls and review conduct—raised concerns about risking undertrained personnel.

OPTION C - Use "Citizen Representatives":
> Marcus Webb, elected Citizen Representative for Recent Full Citizens, exercised his oversight authority to question the operation.

**Recommended**: Option A (cleanest), just clarify military vs political tribune distinction

### Five Service Branches:

**Add mentions** throughout story to show Republic's service diversity:

- Engineering Corps (builds infrastructure)
- Medical Service (healthcare and research)
- Scientific Expedition (exploration and research)
- Civic Administration (governance and education)
- Stellar Legion Service (military)

**Example addition to Act II:**
> The training facility drew instructors from across all five service branches: combat engineers from the Engineering Corps, medical personnel from Medical Service, technical specialists from Scientific Expedition, administrative experts from Civic Administration, and experienced legionaries from Stellar Legion Service. Shield Doctrine required integration across all branches.

---

## PHASE 6: DETECTIVE SUBPLOT REPLACEMENT

### Recommended: The Artifact Network Investigation

**See Document 02 for full details**. Quick implementation:

**Act I (minimal changes):**
- Keep: Webb leaks, Krell attack, Tanaka investigates
- Add: Tanaka notices Webb was contacted by someone who **knew about the artifact**

**Act II (major changes):**
- Remove: Three-tier citizenship reform subplot
- Replace with: Tanaka discovers 15 similar artifacts across Republic space
- Investigation reveals: Someone has been tracking artifact discoveries for decades
- Conspiracy: Kelar have been seeding artifacts to test human development

**Act III (integrate revelation):**
- Keep: Operation Hammerfall proceeds
- Add: Tanaka's investigation concludes—Kelar reveal themselves
- Senate debates: How to handle advanced alien species manipulating humanity's development
- Webb's trial: Was he a traitor or a manipulated pawn?

### Key Additions:

**Act I, after Tanaka finds Webb's communications:**
> But one detail bothered Tanaka: Webb's handler contacted him three days **before** Adeyemi reported the phase-shield breakthrough to Republic Command. How did they know about the artifact? How did they know Obsidian Station would be important?

**Act II, Tanaka's investigation:**
> Tanaka pulled Republic archaeological records going back fifty years. Fifteen artifacts. Fifteen different systems. All found in ancient craters. All catalogued as "unexplained geological formations" and filed away. No one connected them because the discoveries were isolated, different researchers, different decades. But someone else had been connecting them. Someone had been tracking every artifact discovery for half a century, waiting for a human to finally understand what they were.

**Act III, the revelation:**
> The Kelar ambassador's message was cryptic: "We seeded the artifacts 78 years ago when we first encountered your Republic. We wished to see if humanity would develop the understanding independently. You have passed our test. The phase-corridors you discovered—we have used them for millennia. You are ready for the next stage of contact."

---

## PHASE 7: CHARACTER TIMELINE RECONCILIATION

### Ensure ages and service records align with 2746 setting:

**Centurion Chen:**
- Age: 35-40
- Born: 2706-2711
- Grandfather served: 2700-2730 (Liberation Campaigns era)
- Chen joined Legions: 2726-2731 (age 20)
- Promoted to Centurion: 2738-2743 (after 12-15 years)
- **Timeline: ✓ Works**

**Commander Varro:**
- Age: 45-50
- Federal Academy graduate
- 20-25 years service
- **Timeline: ✓ Works**

**Dr. Adeyemi:**
- Age: 40-55
- Civilian researcher, 12+ years service
- Full Citizen (passed examination)
- **Timeline: ✓ Works**

**Lieutenant Tanaka:**
- Age: 30-35
- 10-12 years service
- Intelligence specialist
- **Timeline: ✓ Works**

**No character changes needed**—all timelines compatible with 2746 setting

---

## PHASE 8: ADDING STELLAR REPUBLIC DEPTH

### Sprinkle in worldbuilding details throughout:

**Federal Structure:**
> "The Federal Senate represents 42 member systems, each sending three senators. But the real power often lies in the System Senates—each of the 42 systems governs itself through 50 elected senators who understand local conditions better than distant federal authorities."

**Other Factions:**
> "The Corporate Syndicate would pay billions for this technology. The Terran Remnant would claim it as Earth's birthright. Even the Frontier Independents would scramble to acquire it. But the Meridian Empire—they'd use it to restart the wars we fought sixty years ago."

**Service Branches:**
> "Rodriguez served his first six years in the Engineering Corps before transferring to Legion Service. It showed—he understood infrastructure and fortification better than most pure combat specialists."

**Civic Values:**
> "This is what Fides means," Chen said quietly. "Not blind trust. Trustworthiness proven through actions. Webb violated Fides—not just to the Republic, but to every person on that station. That betrayal cuts deeper than any enemy attack."

**Long History:**
> "The Republic has survived for 600 years—from the desperate generation ships to the federal power we are today. We've endured isolation, war, and hardship. We'll endure this too."
