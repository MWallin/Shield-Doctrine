# SHIELD DOCTRINE SPECIFICS (Canonical)
## Phase-Variance Technology

**Capabilities:**

- Shift objects out of normal spacetime phase
- Pass through solid matter without interaction
- Invisible to conventional sensors
- Phased objects see each other normally

**Limitations:**

- Duration: Personal (20-30 min practical), Shuttle (15-30 min), smaller devices (hours+)
- Communication: Electronic impossible, VLC only, physical sound if touching
- Interaction: Cannot affect normal matter while phased
- Psychological: Strain increases with duration, individual tolerance varies
- Contact: Breaking contact causes materialization (1-2 seconds)
- Detection: Possible exotic energy signatures (unexploited)

**Phase Tolerance Distribution:**

- Severe Intolerance: 30% (cannot serve as boarders)
- Adequate: 50% (functional 5-10 min, support roles)
- Good: 20% (functional 15-20 min, boarding specialists)
- Exceptional: 1% (functional 30-90 min, special operations)

**Scaling Limitations:**

- Personal: ~100kg, 2-5 kW
- Shuttle: ~20,000kg, 500kW-1MW
- Small craft: ~100,000kg, 5-10MW
- Capital ships: Impossible with current technology (power requirements exceed any reactor)

**Rules:**

- Duration can improve with better power management but psychological limits remain
- Tolerance is genetic/biological (not trainable beyond adaptation)
- Cannot phase anything larger than small craft (physics constraint)
- Detection possible but Krell haven't developed it yet (vulnerability for future stories)

## Warp Corridor Technology

**Capabilities:**

- Create stable spatial bridges between two points
- Instantaneous transit through corridor
- Diameter: 3 meters (current portable tech limit)
- Duration: 20-30 minutes depending on power

**Requirements:**

- Two anchors (24 components each: 6 emitters, 8 power cores, 6 stabilizers, 4 calibrators)
- Pre-alignment: 2-4 hours in laboratory before deployment
- Assembly time: 3-5 minutes under ideal conditions, 5-7 minutes in combat
- Carrier positioning: Must maintain position within calculated tolerance

**Limitations:**

- Cannot program on-the-fly (must be pre-aligned to specific endpoints)
- Carrier drift = immediate corridor failure (binary success/failure)
- Gravitational interference complicates longer distances
- Assembly vulnerable period (combat engineers exposed)
- Power consumption scales with distance (limits maximum range)

**Success Rates:**

- Act III (Hammerfall): 75% (36 of 48 successful)
- 6 months post-Hammerfall: 82%
- 12 months: 88%
- 18 months: 90%+

**Rules:**

- Success rate improves with experience and refinement
- Never reaches 100% (some failures always occur)
- Carrier positioning is critical vulnerability
- Cannot easily retarget during battle (pre-alignment required)
- Diameter limited to 3m without major technology breakthrough

## Tactical Doctrine

**Phase One - Insertion (0-90 seconds):**

- Javelin shuttle approaches with phase-shield active
- Team positions against hull, activates personal shields
- Walk through hull into target ship
- No electronic communication (VLC protocols, hand signals)

**Phase Two - Pre-Positioning (90-330 seconds):**

- Team spreads throughout target ship while phased
- Place mines, drones, heavy weapons, relay nodes
- Identify key locations (engineering, bridge, hangar)
- Build comprehensive ambush network

**Phase Three - Staggered Materialization (330-450 seconds):**

- Four legionaries materialize every 5-10 seconds
- Creates psychological confusion about enemy numbers
- Pre-positioned ambushes activate
- VLC coordinates actions (until network degrades)

**Phase Four - Warp Corridor (450+ seconds):**

- Combat engineers assemble anchor under fire (3-7 minutes)
- Corridor opens, reinforcements flood through
- Overwhelming force deployed rapidly
- Systematic capture of critical ship systems

**Variations:**

- When corridor fails: Disruption mission instead
- Heavy resistance: Adapt pre-positioning strategy
- VLC failure: Fall back on pre-mission planning
- Unexpected conditions: Mission command—adapt independently

**Rules:**

- Core four-phase structure maintained
- Timing flexible based on conditions
- Mission command essential (centralized control impossible)
- Failures happen regularly (not magic doctrine)
- Success depends on professional adaptation, not perfect execution

## Training Requirements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Technology Creep:**

- Don't casually introduce new capabilities without justification
- Don't solve problems with previously unmentioned tech
- Don't forget limitations established earlier
- Don't make technology too reliable (failures happen)

**Character Inflation:**

- Don't make everyone exceptional (most are merely competent)
- Don't forget physical and psychological limits
- Don't resolve conflicts too easily
- Don't ignore previous characterization

**Scale Inconsistency:**

- Don't casually mention thousands of ships when hundreds established
- Don't forget manufacturing constraints
- Don't make training faster than established
- Don't ignore logistics requirements

**Tone Violations:**

- Don't make good guys do bad things without consequences
- Don't make enemies stupid (professional opponents)
- Don't cynicism-creep into grimdark
- Don't forget costs of violence and war

**Roman Inspiration Issues:**

- Don't force awkward parallels (organic integration only)
- Don't copy-paste Roman details unchanged
- Don't lose modern military SF feel
- Don't make it historical recreation

## Continuity Management

**When Introducing New Elements:**

1. Check existing canon - Does it contradict established facts?
2. Consider implications - How does it affect established elements?
3. Document clearly - Add to consistency guide for future reference
4. Inform collaborators - If multiple writers, share information

**When Contradictions Arise:**
1. Evaluate priority - Which version better serves universe?
2. Retcon carefully - Only if necessary and done well
3. Document change - Update consistency guide
4. Maintain tone - Don't let corrections feel jarring

**Living Document:**

- This guide will expand as universe develops
- New canonical elements get added
- Flexible elements can be refined into canon
- Contradictions resolved through discussion

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## Technology Questions

**Q: Can phase-shields eventually work on capital ships?**
A: Theoretically yes with massive power sources, but not in current timeline. Would require breakthrough in power generation or phase technology. If developed, creates new story possibilities but changes strategic balance significantly.


**Q: Can FTL communication ever be developed?**

A: No. Physics constraint. Jump drives compress space, not transmit information. Quantum entanglement cannot transmit information. This is firm limitation.


**Q: Can humans be genetically enhanced?**

A: Not in current era. Medical technology advanced but not genetic engineering creating supermen. Cybernetics possible but have trade-offs. Keep humans baseline.


**Q: How fast does technology advance?**

A: Slowly and systematically. Phase-shields are revolution (once per generation), most improvements incremental. 50 years between major breakthroughs typical.
Political Questions


**Q: Can citizenship requirements change?**

A: Within limits. Three-tier system can be refined (timing, specific requirements) but service-through-citizenship core principle is fundamental. Don't dilute to meaninglessness.


**Q: Can Confederation become corrupt/authoritarian?**

A: Not while maintaining universe's noblebright tone. Can show flaws, tensions, debates, but fundamental goodness must remain. If exploring dark timeline, frame as alternate universe or distant future.


**Q: Can worlds leave Confederation?**

A: Theoretically yes but hasn't happened. Voluntary membership means voluntary departure possible, but why would they leave? Creates interesting story tension if explored carefully.


**Q: How many member worlds maximum?**

A: No firm limit. Growth constrained by infrastructure investment requirements and integration capacity. Hundreds possible over centuries, but expansion takes time.

## Character Questions

**Q: Can main trilogy characters appear in other stories?**

A: Yes, with caveats. Respect established characterization. Age them appropriately. Don't overuse (let new characters shine). Get age/rank/position correct for timeline.


**Q: Can characters die in expanded universe stories?**

A: Side characters yes. Main characters (Chen, Varro, Torres, etc.) only if absolutely necessary for story and done respectfully. Death must be meaningful, not casual.


**Q: Can characters change significantly?**

A: Through experience and time, yes. But changes must be earned through events, not arbitrary. Professional competence remains regardless. Core personality traits stable.


**Q: Can new protagonists be better than trilogy characters?**

A: Different, not necessarily better. Chen is exceptional but not superhuman. New characters can have different strengths. Competence comes in many forms.

##  Military Questions

**Q: Can legion structure change?**

A: Minor variations acceptable (specialized legions with different compositions) but core cohort-century-contubernium structure is fundamental. Don't abandon what works.


**Q: Can other branches besides boarding specialists use phase-**shields?
A: Yes. Intelligence operations, reconnaissance, special forces all make sense. But boarding specialists remain primary users (that's their specialized role).


**Q: Can Shield Doctrine be countered?**

A: Yes, and should be eventually. No doctrine remains dominant forever. Future stories about adaptation and counter-adaptation encouraged.


**Q: Can auxiliary forces become as important as legions?**

A: Yes. Specialized capabilities can be crucial. But legions remain backbone. Balance between legion core and auxiliary specialists.


## Story Questions

**Q: Can stories be darker/grittier than trilogy?**

A: Within limits. Can show costs, casualties, difficult decisions. Cannot abandon noblebright tone or make Confederation fundamentally corrupt. Dark moments within optimistic framework.


**Q: Can stories focus on non-military characters?**

A: Absolutely encouraged. Civilian scientists, engineers, administrators, civilians on member worlds all valid protagonists. Universe is bigger than military.


**Q: Can stories show Confederation making mistakes?**

A: Yes. Mistakes, failures, unintended consequences all realistic. Key: Learning from mistakes and improving. Not perfect, but trying to do better.


**Q: Can stories show other nations as positive?**

A: Yes. Confederation is one good system among possible good systems. Other approaches can work. Different doesn't mean wrong. Diversity of human political evolution encouraged.
