## Part 1 - Opening

### Opening: The Mysterious Breakthrough

This first chapter is way to explicit on what the breakthrough is, it uses phase-variance shielding in the fifth paragraph. We need to save this for the discussion between Adeyemi and Chen. 

This chapter also establishes the similarities between phase-shields and jump drives and uses this sentence: "Unless they're not as different as everyone thinks." **Everyone thinks** is the problematic part, he just discovered this technology, so Everyone in this case would just be himself!?

This chapter also has a very different tone from the rest, is just a detailed telling of what happened, there is no actual storytelling going on. The new chapters really tell a story instead of just describing things, not really sure how to phrase it but it feels very off compared to some of the new content. 

I also feel that this chapter does too much:
- It establishes the station
- Talks about the planet and Dr Adeyemi going there
- The Artifact find
- The breakthrough
- How the breakthrough enables phase-shields
- The similarities between phase-shields and jump tech

I think this need to be split up a bit and given more depth. 

Can you do something with the structure below?

Part 1:
- It establishes the station
- Talks about the planet and Dr Adeyemi going there

This should introduce the station and its purpose. It can also talk about the Dr Adeyemi, and others, taking breaks from the routine to explore and experience the planet. Here we can also talk about some of the engineering aspects of the station that is part of the background materials. It being a standardized design and that this outpost is still not using all available space and it constantly being upgraded to the latest specs to stay relevant. This upgrade angle should highlight the Republics long-term commitment to their infrastructure and it being viewed as positive by the staff. 

Part 2: 
- The Artifact find
- The breakthrough

This part should focus on him finding the artifact, analyzing it and the breakthrough is him being able to recreate parts of the field he can analyze. While analyzing the artifact is tells him nothing to start with. It gives off a distinct radiation profile, albeit extremely subtle, but he is in a state-of-the-art lab. He struggles with making sense of it until he remembers that one of the teams had a challenge the other day about who could build the most sensitive quantum field analyzer. The result was generations ahead of anything else they had access to, but basically required its own room of power cells to operate and an insane level of isolation to produce meaningful results. What if he puts the artifact in the examination chamber. And BOOM, this is what enables the Dr to read the quantum resonance patterns. This is not the whole story of the artifact by a long shot, but merely the first layer of the first layer. After sharing this with the other team the next day they set out to build something that can replicate the patterns and this is what turns out to be the first prototype field  generator. What he powers it on for the first time the object the generator is attached to just disappears, and then reappears a few moments later when the power circuit has burned up. The whole team looks at each other as the implications of the new technology starts dawning on them. 

The machine that enabled the breakthrough is itself just an experiment and almost the result of a joke and researchers being a bit childish in their competitiveness, but this time it payed off, BIG TIME. 

Part 3:
- How the breakthrough enables phase-shields
- The similarities between phase-shields and jump tech

Having this in multiple sections would make it flow better. And then we can have the first meeting between Miller between part 2 and part 3. 

The artifact should not be in focus anymore and everything the researches are talking about should be the new field generators. Its not a secret, just not their focus. Perhaps it was also only the Dr closest team that worked with him to analyze it. Sarah Miller is part of this team and explains why she knows about the artifact. And also why the field generators are the big topic of discussion that swept everyone away. 

We should see the science team focusing on building more and more advanced generators and this should play out over a couple of months of actual work. Iterating on power generation, power delivery, field harmonics, the works. Whatever their initial research was about, this new tech just takes precedence and soon all researchers on the station is doing something. Building new housings, running simulations, building more and more sensors to analyze what happened to the object. 

The whole shield thing should wait until Chen names it. But the scientists should establish all the different effects here that Chen later remarks on and that the tactical possibilities are stunning. The research teams are just looking at the pure science aspect. 

The jump tech aspect should be more of a footnote than a major thing for now. 

There might be more things that we need to change in the first chapter. But what I want to get across is that is was basically a fluke that made Dr Adeyemi able to see the artifacts quantum resonance patterns. After this epiphany follows hard and meticulous science work. 

### The Lab Session
The biggest problem here is that Chen is female. He is called Centurion Marcus Chen, see the **Key Characters.md** document in the character folder. 

When they discuss the scale of the field, they shouldn't immediately jump to person scale, just note that bigger takes more power. But they don't yet know how the power scales, they have some rough calculations but they know it is exponential. 

Chen should ask what the Dr thinks about a human size field and that should take them on the discussion they are having. Chen shouldn't immediately go for boarding operations, lets have their focus be on regular combat for now and how being able to actually close with the enemy would make melee combat a viable option in the right circumstance.

They should also discuss the ability the enclosed object has to go through other objects and basically walk through walls. This is also hugely powerful for a military application. Being able to appear where the enemy don't expect you. Walking through living people however should not be on anyones mind just yet. 

The hand signals suggestions shouldn't come up here, its too early. It should be part of the informal discussion. For now, Chen should just be disappointed be the lack of electronic communication and think about preplanned of combat maneuvers and how they never works. Its a desk generals wildest dream, but actual combat cannot be planned like that, if you are lucky you get to plan WHERE combat happens, but HOW, nope. So Chen more or less writes the tech off for dynamic combat situations for now. Sure, it will have its uses, but its not the magic bullet she hoped for. 

Psychological effects also shouldn't be mentioned at all now. The researcher are focusing on drones and no one has given human application the faintest though. They could just note that even if Chen's ideas pan out, getting the tech from working experimentally on drones to something anyone would be willing to let a human try is decades away. 

### The Mess Hall Conversation
Before this scene there should be a new scene where Chen has a briefing with his group leaders and talks about what has been going on since their last weekly briefing. He should mention the shield angle but also note that the lack of electronic communication likely prohibits it from ever being viable for actual combat. 

One of the group leader, a fairly new legionnaire without too much experience should raise his hand and ask about line of sight and hand signals. He could recall some training exercise he remember where the instructors told them all electronics had been wiped out in an EMP and how there were also biological agents everywhere leading to them having to use full hazard gear. Those things combined meant it was almost impossible to talk to each other and they had to rely on hand-signals. The group leader says that when Chen said no electronic communication, it reminded him of that time. As long as they remembered to stay within line-of-sight of each other the hand signals worked much better than they had expected. 

When asked how the actual exercise when the group leader admits that they lost big time. They were so used to all their electronics working all the time that going back to basics was harder in practice than they had thought. 

Chen says he'll bring it up with the Dr next time they meet. And as a bonus, he has all groups to start hand-signal training right away. No-electronics should be part of standard training from now on. But don't overdo it, just don't let anyone forget it completely...

**Now for this actual chapter feedback**
I dont really get why military rations and station fare always is so bad. Can we give them decent food? When on an established station, thats not strictly a military outpost but a research facility I feel that good food makes sense. When on active campaigns and such food quality can suffer maybe, but good food usually brings out the best in people. 

Chen should reference the discussion above where he talked with his team about the communication problem and that they thought about using hand-signals. Chen should press for the Dr to verify if multiple shielded objects can see each other. But the Dr should be wiling, but reluctant since there are so many unknowns and technical issues with the field generators as it is. Trying to solve and figure out tactical communication for a technology that will not get to soldiers in the next 10-20 years doesn't really like a priority…

No discussions about the psychological angle, this should come as a total surprise the first time the shields are used. Since they are only experimenting with drones and objects, this isn't a thing at all yet. Adeyemi can say something general about testing new tech on humans, espescially a tech that essentially makes you dissapear. What happens if a person just don't appear again? Or is something or someone stands where the person materializes. The power control network would have to be orders of magnitude better than what they have now to ensure the one inside can turn of the shield. But that would require them understanding power draw, and that would require the next and the next and the next thing. 

The overall feeling to take away from this chapter should be that Chen views the shield technology as revolutionary, but far into the future and Adeyemi agreeing and if anything, viewing them as further into the future. 

### The Meeting
I like it! This is establishing the right tone and structure. I'm a bit concerened over Webbs motivation though. Now he comes across as only after the money. But I think his motivation should be more complicated. Webb tried to be one of the in crowd when studying but couldn't keep up with the lifestyle which is why he ended up in debt. His handler is made out to represent an organization from a newly joined planet/government that is looking for an edge over the competition and establish itself inside the full republic. This should be something that Webb relates to, wanting to be part of something but not really having what it takes to accomplish it on merit alone. The handler is dangling an official position with the organization as the ultimate reward. When Webb learns about the arifact, he can almost see himself leading his own research division at the organization. 

### The murder 
We desperatley need more content between these two sections! Help me figure out a starting point for this by looking at "Act I - Improvements". It should be around two weeks since "The Meeting". 

It cant start with six hours before the attack, the attack is a complete surprise coming out of nowhwere!

So this has turned into a bit of a mess. In "The Meeting" Webb knows about the research but looses track of this when he learns about the artifact. This is established and good. But the next chapter messes up this point a bit since it talks about both shields and the artifact. The timeline don't work for me. I think "The Meeting" should happen much earlier, shortly after Adeyemi finds the artifact and brings it back to the station. Then between that chapter and this, the breakthrough happens where Adeyemi learns to build the field generator. 

We should probably have another chapter with Webb and Miller, something like this:

**1. The Meeting**
* Webb pressures Miller over information about the new big research going on
* Miller mentions the artifact
* Webb goes bananas over the Artifact news and talks to his handler

**2. New Chapter**
* Miller hasn't gotten the scans yet
* Miller has been involved in the field generator research
* Miller tells Webb about Chen aiding Adeyemi
* Webb want to know more about why, says it might be valuable

**3. The Murder**
* Webb gets the scans and radiation profile of the artifact
* Webb learns about the shield technology
* Miller gets angry when she learns Webb has given out the location 
* Miller is murdered when Webb pushes her

It needs to be dragged out more in time than it is and between 1 and 2 we can talk and go into the research a bit more. Then between 2 and 3 we can show and tell more about turning the research into actual shields. 

The meeting shouldn't be in a maintanence corridor but in one of the unused communication relay stations in the unused section. 

In the struggle Miller gets ahold of Webbs drive and when Webb pushes her she holds on to it but as she hits her head the drive flies away into the room. Webb is paralyzed by fear when realizing Miller is dead and as he hears the legionnaries approach he panicks and tries to find the drive but has to give up as he hears the soldiers coming closer and closer.  Webb should think something along the lines of thankfully he used a reseach drive and since those are fully encrypted, they cant just read it and in 24 hours the drive will wipe itself so he just has to stay out of the way until then. 

### The Investigation Begins
Lets go into a bit more detail about the new welding technique they are testing. It is something one of the researchers came up with after watching the legionnaries during one of their regular excersises. The researcher had worked with reinforced tape for emergeny repairs of hull breaches on space stations and how to make them withstand extreme temperatures. Together with one of the engineers they had come up with a kind of weld tape that was exactly what is sounded like. A tape that was around 5 mm thick with a steel mesh backing and filled with a termite plastic mix. Add a strip to a door seam, apply a high current to set of the reaction and the strip violently welds itself to the surface. Depending on the material it is attached to it forms an extremly solid weld the thickness of the underlying material together with the 1 mm steel mesh as reinforcement. Its not pretty, but it can close a door in a hurry. 

Its a great idea but third group have been trying them out for a few months now and the mixture has been extremely hard to get right. The first attempts just burned through the door and other times the mixture didn't ignite fully making the final weld extremely brittle. But now, on their 56th attempt, maybe, just maybe it will work… 

The drive isn't clutched in one hand but away in a corner. It turns up after careful examination of the room. 

Rodriguez is the leader of her group, shouldn't she her callsign be Third-One instead of Third Three? 

When Chen arrives his first command is for the legionaries on scene to lock down and then to call for reinforcements to secure the wider area, noone in or out. Aftter this he calls Tanaka. When Tanaka arrives Chen tells her that since there are no police Vigiles on the station Tanaka is the closest they have to some sort of investigator, even though he recognizes military intelligence isn't exactly the same. His legionaries are available for her to call whatever she needs. 

Miller is not support staff, she is part of Dr Adeyemis team, so she is cleared for the drive. But those drives shouldn't wander freely around the station, that itself is a serious breach, but more of trust than any actual crime. 

Tanakas initial investigation should just realize that one terminal has been used since it is powered on and working on something, but she cannot yet see what has been done. 

The medical technician, is he Vigiles or Medical Service?  Should probably be Vigiles. Maybe note that full medical examination and autopsy needs to wait for the body to transfer to a station equiped with a full Medical Service outpost or medical ship. They are only equipped for first aid and basic trauma on the research station. 

Lets add one more legionary to the list of suspects, since we need two of them later to be working on the still. This is a thing that will come up later in the investigations on the ship, but should the legionnaries maybe find it when searching the section already? But not have a clear cut person or persons to tie it to?

There needs to be a bit more struggle for Kim to find the programs running on the terminal. And Tanaka should not really underestand and be able to figure out too much of it herself. She needs specialist Kim to really dig into the computer systems. 

When Kim cracks the transmission with the coordinates there should be a note about the artifact as well as the other data they find. Tanaka don't see the significance and ignores it for now to focus on the other, more immediate threat, the stations location. 

This chapter should end with a general notifcation about ships in the system that is sent as routine to the whole station. Tanaka don't yet know anything is amiss but her blood runs cold. 

### Navigation control
The last scene of Part 1 should be a scene from navigation control where the stations monitoring officer tries to contact the newly arrived ships. 

There should be some kind of exchange where on of the staff says finally they are here, she has been looking forward to resupplies for a while now, the mess food is starting to get boring. But wait, the new ships are not on the expected vector, is this some kind of drill? Why can't the convoys just stick to the agreed vectors and make life easy on everybody. 

The new contacts are slow to respond to hails and navigation controll starts to investigate their equipment to see if something is wrong on their end. 

During this more ships appear in the system, right where they are supposed to be, on the aggreed upon vector for the resupply convoy. The convoy right away signals ther arrival in the system and asks for permission to approach the station. Here they can rattle off some of the most important cargo just as routine traffic. They have not yet spotted the unknown ships. 

After more back and forth to try to communicate with the silent ships the monitoring station starts to get a bit nervous about their kit not working and the silence from the unknown ships. Someone swears about research stations not being equipped with military sensors and detection grids. The only thing they have on hand are basic navigation control as well as the research equipment, but that doesn't really help in this situation. 

Someone in the room chips in that maybe they can borrow one of the research telescopes, they are part of standard research station infrastructure and the only thing setting them apart from the military scopes is the attached hardware for pattern recognition, but they should be able to at least get visuals on the ships. 

After messing with this together with some annoyed researchers they finally get visuals on the unknown ships. The telescope is meant to do detailed analysis of stellar objects lightyears away so visual examination of objects that they can almost touch is childs play. 

But hey, someone says after viewing the pictures, these aren't Stellar Republic ships, totally wrong profiles. And that looks like assault craft in the mix, and wait, are they opening hangar doors. One of the legionnaries realizes that the deployment of ships and the opening of hangar doors can only mean one thing, they, whoever they are are preparing to launch assault shuttles towards the station and as he watches, the first shuttles starts to launch. There is total silence in the control room as the group can see how two ships starts firing kinetic slugs towards the station together with swarms of small missiles. 

Centurion Chen, we are under attack, repeat, we are under attack. Standard station assault, I can see five shuttles launced and there are at least 15 more about to launch. We can also see kinetic rounds and missile swarms incomming. Looks like stations supression, likely targeting all obvious sensors and other external equipments together with all communication relays. Sensors says we have three minutes until kinetic hits, then three more until missile impacts and unknown about the shuttles, haven't seen their class before, but guessing from size, say 30 soldiers per shuttle. And oh yeah, the regular supply convoy is also in system and it looks like some of the unknown ships are breaking of the formation and heading for them...

Chen replies with shit shit shit. Sound the alarms, everyone to their stations now! Chen wants to know if the station can move at all, and yes the station can move, but no, not in a timeframe that makes that an option. 

Since this is a research station within their own controlled space, be it on the outskritts, there are no defence platforms or anything like that. An attack on a research station is unheard of, and attacking the Republic just isn't done. Chen has not heard about anything like this in his careeer... 

While the alarms are starting to sound Chen calls his immediate staff for an emergency call where he sets up what to do next. 

Best guess is 20 shuttles somewhere in the next 5 to 10 minutes, no hard numbers, but looks like up towards 600 soliders, these guys are not messing around. I say we fall back to the hangar bay and try to organize an evacuation to the supply convoy that also arrived in system at the same time. 

But sir, out shuttles are messed up after the incident last week, the resupply convoy is bringing spare parts that we need to get them working. Damn, then we will have to rely on their shuttles! 

Chen signals the groups with thieir number, Two, make this happen, coordinate with the convoy. Three, make sure Tanaka gets any help she needs with the murder, lousy timing on that. Four, make sure to get our backup communication in place after the kinetics hit so we can communicate with the convoy. Five, you are in charge of civilian coordination, make sure they start falling back to the hangar section imeediatly. Six through eight, start preparing for the boarders. We are outnnumbered, and likey outgunned, but we are on home turf, make sure to prepare all suprises you can. Rembember to use the override codes to shut down any part of the corridors you need. Three, If the new emergeny weld kit that you trained on is ready for action, distribute them!

We have civilians to protect, get to it!

## Part 2
The last sentences, after the alarm klaxons sound should be the start of the first chapter in Part 2 and here we should see Tanaka scramble to gather and secure her evidence before hurrying to her station.
