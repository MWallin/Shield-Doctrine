# TODO: Military Structure & Rank Systems

**Status:** ACTIVE DECISIONS NEEDED
**Purpose:** Track unresolved military rank and structure questions that need clarification

**Created:** Character development work (Dec 2025)
**Updated:** After milfix.md review - awaiting key decisions

---

## ⚠️ URGENT: 5 KEY DECISIONS NEEDED BEFORE PROCEEDING

**See full analysis in:** `_notes/milfix-analysis-and-recommendations.md`

### DECISION 1: Choose Scale Approach
- [ ] **Option A:** Embrace large numbers (~8,000-12,000 legions, organize hierarchically)
- [ ] **Option B:** Reduce total military (use 0.05% or 0.03% instead of 0.1%)
- [ ] **Option C:** Increase legion size (50K-100K personnel each)

**Recommendation:** Option A

### DECISION 2: Fleet/Legion Personnel Split
- [ ] **Option A:** Keep 50/50 split (requires 100,000+ ships)
- [ ] **Option B:** Realistic fleet size (5-10M fleet, 102-107M legions)

**Recommendation:** Option B

### DECISION 3: Officer Rank Structure
- [ ] **Option A:** Tribune rank for cohort commanders (separate from centurion)
- [ ] **Option B:** Senior centurion (Pilus Prior) as cohort commander (dual role)

**Recommendation:** Option A (Tribune)

### DECISION 4: Century Size
- [ ] **Option A:** Keep 80 legionaries per century (matches existing story)
- [ ] **Option B:** Change to 100 legionaries per century (milfix.md proposal)

**Recommendation:** Option A (80)

### DECISION 5: Commissioning Path
- [ ] Agree with proposal (standard: year 8, exceptional: year 6+)
- [ ] Modify (explain how)

**Recommendation:** Agree

## CRITICAL ISSUES - Stellar Legions

### 1. Centurion Rank Hierarchy

**Problem:** Centurion ranks and hierarchy not fully defined

**What We Know:**
- Centurions command centuries (~80 legionaries)
- There's hierarchy among centurions based on cohort and position
- "Entry-level centurion" vs. "senior centurion" distinction exists
- Primus Pilus = senior centurion, legion second-in-command

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Full centurion rank structure (analogous to Roman system)
- [ ] How many ranks between entry-level centurion and Primus Pilus?
- [ ] Typical progression timeline (how long at each rank?)
- [ ] What distinguishes different centurion ranks? (cohort position? seniority? command size?)

**Roman Historical Reference:**
- Centurions ranked by cohort (1st cohort highest) and position within cohort
- Pilus Prior = first centurion of each cohort
- Primus Pilus = first centurion of first cohort (most senior)
- 59 other centurions in a legion (10 cohorts, 6 centuries each)

**Suggested Structure for Shield Doctrine:**
```
Primus Pilus - Legion second-in-command
Pilus Prior - Senior centurion of each cohort
Senior Centurions - Multiple ranks?
Entry-Level Centurion - Fresh promotion (Chen's current rank)
```

**Impact on Characters:**
- **Chen:** Currently "entry-level centurion" (12 years stuck here)
- **Chen Act III:** Promoted to "senior centurion" (specify which rank?)
- **Kowalski:** Need to clarify his rank progression

---

### 2. Kowalski's Rank System

**Problem:** Inconsistent NCO vs. Centurion designation

**Current Contradictions:**
- Listed as "Master Sergeant/Primus Pilus" (line 338 of Key Characters.md)
- Called "Senior NCO" but also "senior centurion"
- Primus Pilus is officer rank, not NCO

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Clarify Republic's NCO vs. Officer structure
- [ ] Is "Master Sergeant" a rank that exists in Republic military?
- [ ] Does Kowalski START as NCO and get promoted to centurion (officer) in Act III?
- [ ] Or is "centurion" used for both NCO and officer positions at different levels?

**Decision Needed:**
**Option A:** Kowalski is senior NCO (Master Sergeant equivalent) → promoted to officer (Centurion) → eventually Primus Pilus
**Option B:** Republic uses "centurion" for both senior NCO and officer ranks (different levels)
**Option C:** Different terminology entirely

**Impact on Characters:**
- **Kowalski:** Need consistent rank progression path
- **Chen:** Officer-NCO relationship with Kowalski needs clarity

---

### 3. Officer Rank Structure

**Problem:** Modern ranks (Lieutenant, Captain, Commander) mixed with Roman terminology

**Current State:**
- Document says officers exist (O-1, O-2, O-3)
- Uses "Lieutenant" and "Captain" in character titles
- But also uses Roman terms like "Legate," "Centurion"

**What We Know from Stellar Legions doc:**
- O-1: Ensign/Lieutenant (junior officers)
- O-2: (not specified)
- O-3: Company/cohort commanders
- Legate: Legion commanding general (15+ years experience)

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Full officer rank progression (O-1 through Legate)
- [ ] Roman equivalents for each rank
- [ ] Which ranks command what units (century, cohort, legion, etc.)
- [ ] Typical time-in-rank at each level

**Suggested Alignment:**
```
O-1: Optio/Lieutenant - Junior officer, century second-in-command?
O-2: Centurion - Century commander
O-3: Tribune - Cohort commander
O-4: Senior Tribune - Legion staff officer
O-5: Legate - Legion commander
```

**But this conflicts with "centurion" being entry-level for Chen!**

**NEED DECISION:** How do centurions fit into officer structure?

---

### 4. Chen's Title Error

**Problem:** Listed as "Lieutenant/Captain Marcus Chen"

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Change to "Centurion Marcus Chen" throughout document
- [ ] Specify "entry-level centurion" or specific centurion rank once hierarchy defined
- [ ] Act III promotion: specify new rank (senior centurion? which level?)

**Files to Update:**
- Key Characters.md (line 57)
- Any other references

---

## Service Branch Rank Structures

### Engineering Corps

**Status:** NEEDS DETAILED RANK STRUCTURE

**What We Know:**
- Lead Engineer (contracted professional, 10+ years)
- Project Engineers (3-5 contracted professionals)
- Journeyman Engineers (service members, years 6-8)
- Apprentices (service members, years 3-5)

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Formal rank titles (if any)
- [ ] Progression path
- [ ] How are engineers addressed? (rank? title? name?)

**Impact on Characters:**
- **Torres:** Chief Engineer - is this a rank or position?

---

### Scientific Expedition

**Status:** NEEDS DETAILED RANK STRUCTURE

**What We Know:**
- "Lead researcher" positions exist
- Rank based on years of service and achievements

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Formal rank/title structure
- [ ] Progression path for researchers
- [ ] How are scientists addressed?

**Impact on Characters:**
- **Adeyemi:** Listed as "Lead researcher" - clarify this is position, not rank
- **Adeyemi:** What's his actual rank/title in Scientific Track?

---

### Intelligence Service

**Status:** NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Problem:** Uses modern military ranks (Lieutenant, Commander) but unclear if part of Legions or separate

**What We Know:**
- Tanaka listed as "Lieutenant/Commander"
- Intelligence described as separate from Vigiles

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Is intelligence part of Stellar Legions or separate branch?
- [ ] If part of Legions: uses same rank structure?
- [ ] If separate: what rank structure?
- [ ] How do intelligence ranks translate to Legion ranks?

**Impact on Characters:**
- **Tanaka:** Current rank unclear
- **Tanaka Act III:** "Commander and head of Confederation Counter-Intelligence" - what rank exactly?

---

### Vigiles Service

**Status:** CHECK EXISTING DOCUMENT

**Action Needed:**
- [ ] Read "The Stellar Republic - Vigiles Service.md"
- [ ] Extract rank structure information
- [ ] Check if compatible with other branches

---

## Related Issues

### Citizenship and Rank

**Question:** Does rank affect citizenship timeline?

**What We Know:**
- Officers and enlisted both: 8 years → Resident, 12 years → Full
- Federal Academy counts as first 4 years of service for officers
- No special citizenship for officers

**What We Need:**
- [ ] Confirm rank doesn't affect citizenship timeline
- [ ] Clarify how promotions work within 8-12 year service window

---

### Forms of Address

**What We Need:**
- [ ] How are different ranks addressed in dialogue?
- [ ] "Centurion Chen" vs. "Centurion" vs. "sir" vs. name?
- [ ] Does it vary by situation (formal vs. informal, on duty vs. off)?

---

## Work Plan

**Immediate (Before Act I v8.3 Writing):**
1. Define basic centurion hierarchy (entry-level vs. senior)
2. Clarify Kowalski's rank (NCO or officer?)
3. Fix Chen's title to "Centurion"
4. Determine Tanaka's rank system (military or separate?)

**Short Term (During Act I Development):**
5. Create full Legion officer rank chart
6. Define Engineering Corps formal structure
7. Define Scientific Track formal structure
8. Create forms of address guide

**Long Term (Before Acts II-III):**
9. Complete all branch rank structures
10. Ensure cross-branch consistency
11. Update all character profiles with correct ranks
12. Create quick reference chart for writers

## Notes & References

**Roman Centurion Ranks (Historical):**
- Primus Pilus (first spear) - Most senior
- Pilus Prior - First centurion of cohorts 2-10
- Pilus Posterior - Second centurion of cohorts 2-10
- Princeps Prior - Third centurion
- Princeps Posterior - Fourth centurion
