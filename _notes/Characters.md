We need to define and establish our main characters a bit more.

For Act 1, I think we should focus on Dr Adeyemi and Centurion Chen with Tanaka as prominnent support. Varro and Torres feature but should be a bit on the side for now. 

Act 2 should feature Varros perspective more but with a clear focus on Chen. This probably goes for Act 3 also. But overall 2 and 3 are a bit too distant now to make any hard calls. 

# Take 1
## Chen
Chen should be a professional soldier through and through but he hasn't really seen any major conflicts during his career. This has made him a bit set in his thinking and a stickler for procedure in military matters. He has forgotten what it means to improvise and instead focuses on everyone following procedure and do things in the correct order. 

When faced with the shield technology he is reluctant to use them since he and Adeyemi agreed that they are far from ready. When he runs out of options he is forced to either try them or fail in his mission. After seeing how effective their use is in the first battle he starts to realize that there might be more to combat than regulations. But this must be very balanced with him not beeing an incompetant officer but liked and respected, but maybe a bit too heavy on the traditional. 

Chen should also be wanting revenge on those who were killed and he feels he has failed in his mission to protect the soldiers under his command and the civilians he were there to protect. This should then be a bigger theme where we explore what revenge is compared to justice and how far it is reasonable to go to hunt down those who are behind the attack. 

This could also be an opportuinity to explore justice across factions. The Stellar Republic has been attacked unprovoced, but the corporate faction that has the mercenary base within its territory don't recognize the Republics right to justice. It was a contract that was carried out and that is no crime. Regrettful that there was loss of life, but this is not recognized as a crime, more a bad/wasteful business decision. 

So something like Chen struggles to adapt to the new technology because he isn't used to improvise and when hit with actual losses in his command and those he were meant to protect he struggles with how to avenge them without becomming them. This must tie in with the explicit value system and what it allows him to do. 

Chens struggle should be even worse when in Act 2 he realizes that the shield technology actually enables him to go after the mercenaries and win. This struggle should also face the Republic as a whole. They have never sought to project power and even though they have a military capability, using that offensively has never been high on the agenda. But with the shield technology they might have a weapon system that can be used more like a scalpel than a broadsword. Just because they can use this weapon, should they. And how far should they go. If they just right every wrong they see, does that make them good guys or bad guys. What right to they have to impose their will on others. Chen should experience the microperspective of this bigger question that the Republic struggles with. 

## Dr Adeyemi
Adeyemy is too good and likeable. He needs a flaw or two. Perhaps he is a second rate scientist that just happened to crack the shield technology. The research station might have been his last hope to make something of himself before he gives up on his career. 

Maybe he has always had a hard time collaborating with others and the shield research and development is his opportunity to realize that he isn't a lone wolfer but actually an organizer. He realizes that he sees talent in others and can help them do the actual work by removing blockers and solving organizational problems rather than hard science ones. 

This might be how we keep him and his viewpoint around through the acts, he turns into the shield programs science manager. 

## Tanaka
Tanaka knows everything there is to know about military intelligence and hostile forces disposition and all that stuff. She can recognize and identify all known hostile ship profiles and knows how to infiltrate enemy organizations and interrogate war prisoners. She also knows a thing or two about counter-espionage and what to be alert for. 

Her actual knowledge of how to conduct a murder investgation is somewhere around zero. She has watched the popular movies and her favorite books are about an awkward layer who always manages to win his cases despite all odds. This gives here a bit of insight to how complicated it is to actually investigate something and get it right so her confidence going in to the investigation isn't on top. 

She never even considered Vigiles service, much less detective work but she realizes that the difference might not be as big as she first feared.  

# Take 2
Wow, your feedback is brilliant! Thanks for helping me to organize my ideas!

Lets start with what need more development for each Character

## Chen
Regulations are an interesting topic. If we reference them to closely we probably need something that makes sense and military regulations isn't my strongest suite. But lets start brainstorming and see what we can come up with. 

I think that he is very strict about following procedure and writing reports. If regulations says there needs to be weekly briefing with command staff he holds them religously and writes up everyone who is absent without cause. It is within his rights but most officers on station duty realizes that not much happens and allows for more informal weekly reporting. This is because he wants to have a correct and impressive papertrail that shows him following procedure. This is in an effort to impress on the chain of command who hasn't been willing to promote him. 

I think the Republic military is a bit stiff and set in its ways since they haven't actually been engaged in any peer or near peer conflicts since, basically never. There has been some engagements but those were mostly peace keeping missions or where the Republic had overwhelming firepower. The military as a whole has come to value procedure more than result since they don't have any real sense of what results means for a military engaged in high-stakes combat. 

As a result of this promotions has often been awarded to those who follows procedure rather than brilliant combat tacticians or leaders of men. This should be the core of all military forces but by now its ingrained within the Republic. This is not to say that the Republics military force isn't dangerous, its just not as dangerous as it could be. 

All of this combined has ended with Chen striving to be paper perfect in order to advance his position after the posting at the station. Perhaps Chen was only stationed at the station because another Centurion got the interesting position at one of the frontier planets. Babysitting a bunch of scientists isn't really something he relishes. 

Early in his career he was mentored by another Centurion who went out of his way to follow every regulation in the book, no matter how awkward it could make things. This really impressed Chen that this man remembered every regulation and here he woved to be at least as good. Since then Chens way to centurion was straight and easy which he has attributed to him following regulations so closely. 

The truth isn't quite as flattering. In reality Chen's strictness with regulations made him impossible to work with for most of his fellow officers and instead of having him stick around they promoted him or recommended him for advanced training, somewhere else. This made his road to full centurion and independent command quick. But it has also led to him having a lot of solo postings without any real stakes. 

Lately he has begun to see that he has spent a very long time as centurion when others, less qualified to his eyes, have moved on in their careers.

When the situation with the shields comes up and he is forced to use unauthorized and untested hardware without any attached doctrine or battle plan he must readjust his attitude to follow regulations first and always… 

I think we should use Kowalski as a catalyst. When the situation is beyond grim he brings up the shields and if they can be used. Chen should refuse out of hand but Kowlski should push, and hard for Chen to let go of his rigid thinking and actually be a real officer instead of a paperpusher and try leading from the front. Continuing a tactic that doesn't work and has already killed a number of their men will only led to more death. But maybe ignoring regulations and trying something new is just the thing. And what the hell, they will likely die in both situations…

Arc: 
* Act I Start: Very good
* Act I Crisis: Forced to improvise and sees the effectiveness. Should struggle afterwards with if he should have made this move sooner.
* Act I End: He agrees with the value of deviating from regulations and proper procedure. But when to do so and which regulations are okay to be less strict with. This can be a discussion with his officers at the after-action-review at the closing of the act. Here we should also start to discuss the need for revenge which should then lead the discussion to how much revenge, and on whom? Do they kill the mercenaries who took part of the attack, those who planned the attack, those who ordered it, those sho financed it? Where do you draw the line? And is it morally right to risk their own lives to get revenge for those who were killed, what if this leads to more killing. What is actually the moral thing to do? Not get justice because it has the least risk also sounds stupid.
* Act II: Grappling with the new offensive power and continue to explore how far to take the revenge. We likely have another conflict with the mercenaries in Act II and maybe we realize who are actually behind them. Do they continue their hunt for justice despite having won over the mercenaries. Where does it end? Chen is also praised by command for his combat improvisation and asked to continue refining the use of shields in combat. Drawing from his recent experience together with RELEVANT procedures and doctrine he starts shaping something new but still struggles with finding balance between tradition and inovation.  
* Act III: The end should show him continuing to adapt and having struck a balance both with doctrine and what it means to have achieved justice/revenge for those who have fallen. (Although I have no idea what a morally acceptable justice would look like just now.)

## Dr. Adeyemi
The opening scene, where we find Adeyemi on the planet for some alone time should be him fleeing the station after yet another conflict with one of the other department heads. Adeyemi always visits the surface since no-one else is around and this gives him time to cool down and reflect. 

Adeyemi grew up in a family where Science Track was the only choice. He was the latest in a long line of brilliant scientists, one of the Adeyemis had even been lead researcher of the breakthrough that enabled substantial improvents to interstellar travels, the lightbringer class. 

But Adeyemi isn't as brilliant as everyone expects him to be. True, he as good theories but he constantly fails in the lab when it comes to actually designing experiments to validate his thinking. And when he actually succeds he nevere quite manages to get the reports correct which always ends with him talking a lot and never getting anywhere. This has led him to question his career as a researcher and he has decided that if he cannot make it while on the station he will resign his position. 

One of his biggest struggles is to collaborate with others since all of his predecessors apparently made it wholly on their own. Or at least, that is how the family histories are told and what young Adeyemi grew up beliving. While doing his service he tried to collaborate but it was a constant struggle as he was always afraid someone else would achive better results with his ideas and steal the spotlight. This is unthinkable for an Adeyemi who should always achieve independent success. 

After bringing the arifact back to the station Adeyemi hears about the experimental scanner from Miller he thinks to use the device himself. But after Miller explaining the workings of it he realizes he needs her help to get the scanner working. He is then faced with a decision, actually collaborate with someone on the research in order for the research to happen or abandon this line of research completely. 

Miller is very reluctant to help Adeyemi since she is well aware of his reputation. But here it gets brilliant, she chooses to collaborate with him despite her misgivings since she is being blackmailed by Webb. She realizes that Webb would be interested in the artifact and in order for her to get close to it she needs to be close with Adeyemi. So she is only starting the collaboration for her own self-interest in getting away from Webb, not because she wants to collaborate with Adeyemi. 

(( IDEA OUT OF ORDER: When we start to roll up and investigate the murder we should get some insight into Millers perspective and here we might use this angle. We could use it to confuse Adeyemi and make him doubt himself. Maybe his collaboration skills arent any good and it was all because Miller pushed him and told him what to do and say. But in the end Miller was just a catalyst and it is Adeyemi who enables the collaboration and he can do it without relying on Miller for support. Once he got started his old skills resurfaced and it almost felt like conducting an orchestra. ))

The object is just too interesting and together with Miller he starts setting up the scanner. They soon realize just how experimental the thing was and they need to enlist more help to get the scanner up and working. This requires Adeyemi to collaborate with not only Miller but also Dr. Patel and Dr. Chen (who by the ways needs another name in 8.3, we cannot have a Dr. Chen and a Centurion Chen, come on ;). Getting engineers and scientists to collaborate is usually a challenge but Adeyemi realizes he has a knack for bridging the gap between them and they soon get the scanner to work and this is when the real fun begins. 

In his youth, before starting his service with the Science branch Adeyemi used to be engaged in different youth groups and often ended up as mediator between differenct factions and groups at contests. This was before his family started putting a lot of pressure on him to succed in research on his own and he enjoyed the collaboration and helping different outlooks merge and align. These youth groups had nothing to do with science but involved engaging with youth groups from all service branches as they took part in the different contests his school organized. 

When starting his service his family actively discouraged collaboration, not outright and with those words but the emphasis was always on him taking his rightful place as a scientist in some important breakthrough. This meant he forgot, or at least didn't realize the potential he had for collaboration as that was never deemed important by those whose approval he sought, his family and ancestors. 

Arc: 
* Act I Start: Desperate researcher who's difficult to work with, fears he's wasting his last chance
* Act I Crisis: Shield breakthrough happens almost accidentally - he's excited but also terrified it's just luck. Starts to see the value of collaborative effort within his domain
* Act I End: Shields worked in combat, but he knows it was rushed. Makes him think about his own limitations in bringing the technology forward on his own but is impressed with what he managed to do with a team...
* Act II: Learns to organize research teams, discovers his real talent is enabling others
* Act III: Established as shield program leader not because he's the smartest, but because he's the best at coordinating all the different wills and direction ang making it into something coherent

## Tanaka
Is it a problem for Tanaka to also undergo an: Another "character out of comfort zone" arc. Or is her circumstance and setting different enough to make work? 

I'm gonna assume we can work something out along this line so I will adress the things you raised. 

Since Tanakas favorite books are about a lawyer she has some ideas about what it takes to make a case and win in court. But she has never read that much about actual police and detective work so she is totally lost when it comes to actually secure a crime scene and gather evidence. Evidence chain are words she has heard, but there is no meaning or context to them. And it doesn't help that her crime scene is about to turn into a combt zone. 

She tries to think about the legal novels and quickly realizes she needs to secure and collect evidence as soon as she can. And that no one should touch the body before it has been examined. But too late, the legionaries first on scene moved and inspected the body before they realised Miller was already dead. They also clamped around all over her crime scene without any clear idea of what they were doing. But thankfully they found the data drive. 

Tanaka reaches out to everyone on the station for someone with Vigiles experience to help her. She finds a couple that transfered out from the service early into scence wich isn't what she needs. But she manages to find an older researcher who actually worked as a detective for a couple of years in a big city before moving on to "less deadly" puzzles. However the attack happens before they actually get to their first meeting and the former detective is one of the casualties. 

After the attack the first interviews Tanaka holds with the survivors on the suspect list goes badly. She has no idea on how to follow civilian interrogation protocols, and she has no good place on the ship to conduct the interviews. She manages to get recording devices up and running but she has no idea if they will be valid as evidence. Interrogating survivors from a horrible and unprovoked attack about a random murder seems a bit out there. 

We also have the red herring of the soldiers who are distilling liquour. Tanaka saw these soldiers as very likely candidates as their alibies didn't quite work. After she realizes their worst offence was supplying unauthorized booze she almost gives up on the whole thing. 

In the attack Millers body is also lost together with the whole station and this effectively puts an end getting any more evidence. The only hope rests with the data drive and the encryption thing has a deadline attached. After a lot of back and forth Tanaka and Torres manages to get data from the device. 

This brings a whole new dimension to the murder investigation. It no longer a random killing. Its selling Republic secrets to the enemy, even if who the enemy is is kind of obscure at the moment. This puts the whole thing squarely back into what Tanaka knows, counter-intelligence and interrogating enemy spies!

Despite the data on the drive she realize that she needs a confession to make her case watertight and her background and knowledge for how to teal with enemy spies gives just the tools she need. 

Suggested Arc:
* Act I Start: Confident in military intelligence, nervous about murder investigation
* Act I Development: Makes 1-2 mistakes, but adapts and learns quickly
* Act I End: Successfully solves case by combining military intel skills with improvised detective work
* Act II-III: Expands to counter-intelligence, realizes skills ARE transferable

## Bernhardt's Work
Please be mindful of Bernhardt's work when it comes to making the characters come to life. I am really impressed with his books and think their influence on me and this series can only be a very very good thing! 

Please continue to advise on how to align with his ideas!

## Next steps
1. Update Key Characters, this document needs a serious overhaul after looking at it a bit for this excercise.
2. Yes please, we need to start sketching out the character arcs.
3. This then goes into me actually needing an outline for the books. This is a bigger task so lets keep the key scens in the character arc document for now so we know what we need to work into the outline.
4. I'm not really sure what this means, please give some examples for what it means to have Character contradictions and how this could be done for these characters.

# Take 3
## Inconsistencies
### 1
Lets stick with Centurion Marcus Chen for now. We have some work to do to finalize the Stellar Republics military structure. 

### 2
Lets go with him making centurion in 6 years. I am thinking this is the earliest its going to be possible to get this rank. Centurion ranking is a bit of a mess copy straight over so as above, we need to do some work here to make it easy to understand and to follow. But for now, centurion of the same rank for 12 years has made Chen question if he is going to be stuck here.

### 3
Yep, this structure needs work. We have held off on going all the way with the actual military structure, I think this is gonna be our next area of work so that we can get these kind of titles correct. 

### 4
Have it state that he is promotet to senior centurion. 

### 5 
Rose quickliy to entry level centurion, but then has been stuck there. 

### 6
This is a bit tricky. Advaning from entry level centurion requires documented combat skills. Plus, all centurions can lead individual postings. Perhaps having Chen rotate through different distant outposts for babysittning civilians is an easy way for higher-ups to handle him. 

### 7
Lets wait on this for now until we complete the military structure. 

### 8
Lets wait on this one also. 

### 9
I think he is on year 12 of his service, almost there to reach full citizenship, but still has a few more months to go. Reaching full citizenship is a hard requirement from his family and this also unlocks options for him. As a full citizen he can escape some of the pressure from his family and get a federal position anywhere in the republic and not have to rely on his family connections. "His last chance" mostly refers to him not having made any expected breakthrough yet. If he cannot make a breakthrough on the station with all the resources available, when will he ever make it. His decision is that if he hasn't made it before becoming a full citizen he will never to any research again. 

### 10 
Remove. I dont think the branches loans out people, instead there is an established tradition of working together in joint commands. 

### 11
Fix as you propose

### 12
Adeyemi is the lead researched in his area of study, planetary geology. The rank at the station is more an acknowledgement of his years of service than something he has actually achieved. As a lead in his are of study he is expected to teach and involve the juniors in his department but his fear of someone stealing his thunder makes this very hard for him. This is the main reason for his conflict with the stations research leadership, there are so many complaints against him for not involving his staff and teaching them as i ought to. 

### 13
Go with Dr. Singh. 

### 14
Hold off on this until we do the military structures. Mark it, together with the other ones we have held off on that we need to come back and finish the job. 

### 15
Same as above, mark this, but hold off on actually fixing it. 

### 16
Oh, I'm not sure how many named planets or citys we actually have in our exisitng world-building. See if you can come up with something from the world-building folder. Otherwise, please come up with names and add a document to the world-building folder with the names. 

### 17
Yup, this is what we will be working on next. 

### 18 
I think this is actually clear in the world-building, its just the character document that hasn't kept up. Everyone gets Resident citizenship after serving for 8 years. Fullt citizenship takes 12 years and an examination. Please update out three current characters with their current citizenship status based on their length of service. 

### 19
Yes, each service has their own rank structure, I think this is laid out in each branch document in the world-building. Otherwise, note somewhere that we need to work on this.
