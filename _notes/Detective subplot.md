# Round 1
Key details & Questions

The Aliens
Lets go with the Corporate Syndicate (Corporation, or Corps for real short) for the other human faction. They aren't really into science for science sake so they just call the aliens for "Partners" as in Business Partners and it stuck. What they call themselves the Corporations didn't bother to learn. 

The Partners came in contact with the Corps when a Corp exploration mission stumbled across an outpost of theirs in a system they were looking to settle. The Partners were not alarmed and seemed familiar with other species so the Corp quickly began communications. After the initial success real communication took a very long time to establish and only got so far. Different frames of reference meant that anything not grounded in science and math is hard to get across. 

The Corps realized that the Partners had a fairly similar technology base to humans but that their space ships were far more advanced. At first the Partners were uninterested in trading but as a last effort from the Corps the Partners were invited to a museum to see if they could make the Partners interested in something they had. Here the Partners got excited about a stupid piece of rock in one of the archaeological exhibits. When the Partners examined the rock it started glowing and after a short while the Partners managed to get across that the rock actually was a storage device that was "lost" and they really wanted it. Here is where the Corps realized that the rock was an incredibly valuable artifact and that they finally had something to barter with. 

The Partners refused to share how to access the artifact but where after long and tedious negotiations willing to part with one of their ships for the artifact. The Corps agreed since they couldn't use the artifact, but reverse engineer others technological marvels was something they were familiar with...

I do not want to go into depth about the Partners in Act I, or maybe not even mention them but save that for Act II or III. 


The humans
The Corporate Syndicate (Corporation, or Corps for real short) is now scouring known space looking for artifacts and they realized that they already had a few in their possession, it was just that they were so hard to recognize as something valuable. After studying the artifacts intensely they eventually learned that they give off a certain radiation. Its not huge and can easily be explained away given that most artifacts were found on planets without atmosphere and exposed to cosmic radiation. But they radiation profile was identical across all artifacts the Corps examined and they soon developed a dedicated scanner to verify artifacts. 

To broaden their search the Corps don't hesitate contacting freelance mercenaries and to use their services to obtain artifacts from "unwilling" sellers. 

The Corps have set up a system of informants across multiple other factions that are on the lookout for these artifacts. After verifying the artifact is genuine the informant is supposed to get it back to their handler. Depending on the situation the handler decides what the best approach is, bribe someone, a discrete murder or just a smash and grab by ruthless mercenaries. The key is no direct involvement and no traces leading back to them.


The Artifacts
The artifacts are part of an encyclopedia that an old civilization gave out at the height of their power when they realized most other species were so much less developed and uninteresting to interact with. The idea was to bootstrap other species and see what happened. 

There were a few obvious problem though. The encyclopedia was written in a language almost impossible to decode, using patterns and concepts that are impossible to understand and housed in a device with an uncrackable shield. The idea was that someone smart enough to actually read it would be smart enough to use it. 

A lot of artifacts has been found but almost all have been discarded as trash. The Partners found a way to open the artifact and get to the actual puzzle inside. They haven't actually decoded anything useful, but just the process of opening the devices and looking at the insides have helped them bootstrap their spaceflight technology by orders of magnitude. 

The empire that created the artifacts are gone since millions of years, but these artifacts are still around and sound as ever. But perhaps their shielding and disguises are a bit too sophisticated for anyone to actually understand the Empires brilliance. 


Webb
Webb made a few bad choices in his youth gambling when he was studying for the science branch. He wanted to be with the nice families that always had money in the hope that it would rub off on him. It never really did and he had to spend more and more to cope with their habits. Webb was so glad when he made a new friend who helped him out with money a few times and then made a friendly and honorable deal to pay off all his debts if Webb would just share a few tidbits of research here and there. This quickly escalated however and soon Webb sold new research for money. Webb was hooked on the lifestyle and soon his handler introduced him to the artifact scheme. He promised a huge payout if Webb could relay information about authentic artifacts. 

Webb doesn't know he is working for the Corps, not that he might have an actual problem with it if he knew. But his handler is more professional than that. The handler has let slip that Webb is not the only one selling information when Webb tried to press for more money. Webb doesn't view himself as a traitor in the classic sense, he views the whole situation as something he is in control over and that it was actually his own idea. He needed money and his "friend" was interested and just happened to bet money on Webb not being able to actually provide the full research paper that time. Webb just had to prove that he could and over time this slowly became a pattern. In reality Webb is the biggest fool and has been on a leach from day one. 

The Corps can well pretend to be from within the republic and use names and such that fit in with that theme. The have been in the industrial espionage business long enough to be actual professional. 


The Attack
Miller is used by Webb to gain access to Dr Adeyemis research and this way Webb finds out about the artifact. Webb might have something on Miller that he uses as blackmail to get her to provide him with information. Miller don't see the harm at first and the whole situation is so embarrassing. When Webb learns about the artifact he pushes Miller more and more and this leads to their argument. Webb contacted his handler right away when he learned about the artifact. 

The handler quickly realizes that the Republic will never sell or handover their artifact for money and they don't exactly see eye to eye with the Corps on very much. 

The handler is tired of Webb always trying to play him and when he researches the stations location he realizes he can solve all his problems in one move. He contracts the Firestorm Mercenaries to raid the station, collect the artifact and kill Webb, nice and clean and no evidence afterwards of Webb being a traitor. 

The handler didn't count on just how much of a coward Webb is when it comes to physical harm and that the Firestorm Mercs has a reputation of leaving no one alive. When Webb learns who are attacking the station he gets desperate to escape and manages to get to the hangar in time. The Mercs hasn't fought the legionnaires in a space station before and aren't prepared for their delaying actions and booby traps and the sheer stubbornness of every single one of them. After loosing way more assault troops than they had planned for they are forced to bring out their heavy assault suits. When they enter the scene the legionaries starts loosing ground and this is when the shield scene plays out as the legionnaires don't have the firepower on hand to stop the assault suits without blowing up the station. They are there more as peace keepers and general engineering support in case of unforeseen disasters. Not to engage in heavy close quarter combat with assault suits more at home in heavy planetary actions. But when Chen realizes they have an opportunity to get up and personal, walk right through the devastating firepower and armored shield wall the assault suits are deploying, they just might have a chance. Chen's group phases and gets right close to the assault suits and deploy their molecular blades making short work of the suits which aren't at all meant to do close quarter fighting. Against swords with molecular edges that are able to cut through most anything they just fall apart. This gives the station crew and the remaining legionaries time to withdraw to the hangars in something that might have resembled order. 

The Firestorm Mercs don't care about individual losses, they have a contract to fulfill and know that the Corps are willing to pay almost anything to get what they want. The Mercs don't have that many troops left and instead of committing the rest of them to the fight they start deploying their favorite trick. Small hunter killer drones filled with Firestorm chemicals. The drones are slightly over 7 cm and able to dart around like small birds. The core of the drone is a glass ball filled with a blue liquid and a small wing and control package. They have a basic thermal camera that is just smart enough to pick out human bodies and as the Mercs pull back to safe positions they flood the corridors with their drones. The legionnaires cannot fight this type of assault with what they have on the station, when a drone spots a human they just fly and crash into it and destroying the glass container in the process. The blue liquid ignites when in contact with air and aggressively burn in contact with basically anything, if it is carbon based however, the reaction accelerates. 

The Mercs slowly designated sectors as clear as the Firedrones clear the way and they advance on the hangars. The legionnaires double down on their delaying actions as they fall back since they know they have to stop the drones from getting to them. 


Questions
1, See above. 
2, No Corps involvement revealed in Act I. Tanaka speculates about it with Varro given the resources it would take to engage the Mercenaries. But there is no evidence yet. 
3, See above.
4, The Krell has to go, the cyborgs has to die. 
5, In Act II Tanaka should be able to uncover a lot of the artifact trafficking but she cannot fathom why they are doing it. After a while she manages to track one Handler, she realizes that there are probably more than one of them inside the Republic. From the Handler she learns about the Partners, but don't make the connection to aliens and just assumes that they are some kind of business partner of the Corps, maybe the Meridian Empire. In Act III we probably should reveal more about the Partners and the Corps relations with them. 



# Round 2
So I'll start from the bottom this time: 

We focus only on Act I now. If we make this work and feel good, then we have a framework for how to change the other acts instead of having one big moving target. There will likely be changes in Act II or III that requires us to go back to Act I anyways...

You should ask questions, the more the better, and wait for answers! This gives me time and a place to think and build on your ideas. 

When something is unclear in the correctness/02-Alternative-Detective-Subplot.md, reference Act I v7 for the latest story state. 

7, Immediate questions
A: Miller is murdered by Webb when Miller find out that Webb has leaked the stations coordinates to his handler. This is basically the current state of v7, although its not shown right now but more implied. Lets add a short section about Miller and Webb meeting up and Webb pressing Miller for more information about the artifact and the current research. Webb learns from Miller that Adeyemi has made a breakthrough with phase shields which leads to Webb saying something about him should have included that with the location, that would have made him rich. Miller looses is when she hears location and commence fight scene. In this section we don't use their names, gender or anything that can identify them. 

B, The Republic has extensive files on all known merc companies but no up to date locations or exact numbers. They know they are their but as long as they don't mess in Republic space, they leave each other alone. The Republic isn't the police force in the galaxy, they don't have the reach or firepower for that. Shield Doctrine gives them completely different tools. But that is more for the ending of Act III. 

Tanaka recognizes the Firestorm emblems from her security/intelligence training. She also remembers that they seldom fight for their own cause but sells to the highest bidder. 

C, After Webb is broken he is imprisoned on the ship as in Act I v7 until they return. He will face tribunal in Act II which will give us an opportunity to explore the justice system. 

D, The Firestorm Mercs are more like Wagner, but fully legitimate and independent. Their main base is unknown by the Republic but they have outposts in a lot of factions and are easy to get in touch with for those with enough need. Their disregard for civilian life makes them not outright banned from the Republic but shunned. From time to time they are hired by some corporation or family feud or similar gone seriously wrong. But when operating within the republic they kind of behave. They know the legionnaires are watching and they respect the Republic intelligence. 

All merc companies employ various hunter-killer drones as they are cheap and can usually be setup without leaving a trace. Shipping a crate of drones to a competing business and then when the facility shuts down for the day the crate opens automatically to release the swarm is a common tactic. The drones can then scan and read all available data they find and then attach to structural building elements and detonate in a coordinated strike. Within the republic such attacks usually happens at night without too much loss of life, but from time to time someone pays enough to make an example and the swarm release during they day and starts hunting people. The swarm is fully autonomous and more or less impossible to stop. Kinetics is the only counter and before enough capable counters can be deployed the loss of life can be significant. 

War crimes isn't really a thing, or it is within the Republic. But since out factions are so large and have such varying views that is one factions war crime is another factions standard tactics. 

The Firestorm mercs are expensive and ruthless and take pride in getting the job done, whatever it takes. "War crimes" just cost a bit more. 

All Firestorm mercs have standard death-on-capture contracts which makes interrogating them beyond hard. Before engaging in an assault every merc starts a timer on a small explosive inserted into their neck. This gets reset at regular intervals during the assault and deactivated at the end of a mission. This makes the mercs willing to take devastating losses to gain their objectives and impossible to interrogate even if they are taken as prisoners. The window of opportunity for interrogation is usually to short to get qualified personnel in place and the boots on the ground don't know anything. Usually not even the location of the headquarters, just the last staging post or their designated outpost. But operational security matters and individual life is cheap. 

E, Tanaka figures out that Webb has a handler during the interrogation. But she cannot decode all data on the drive with the resources on the cruiser. The beg investigation will have to wait until Act II. However, Act I cannot end on a cliffhanger but it should feel that the immediate investigation is resolved but that there is a bigger threat to deal with. She doesn't suspect the Corps, other than that they have the resources and are on the list. 

F, Drones are common to all mercs. But the actual chemical load out of these drones hasn't been seen before. Chemicals that burn hotter when in contact with carbon, such as human flesh is not technically new, but the Republic hasn't seen that incorporated in drones before. The Legionnaires have some skill and training with countering drones, but drones that turn into lethal fireballs throwing fire in your own direction that cannot be put out, that is new. Standard practice for dealing with drones is basically to have a lot of open space and to deploy shotgun style weapon that cover a lot of surface area. The drones also have fairly poor targeting and mercs usually don't bother with IFF so they are just as likely to attack their own forces if not expertly controlled. The Legionnaires dont have the equipment on hand to counter the drones within the station. It is a new situation for them and they will have to adapt to counter this going forward. 


# Round 3

A lot of this is covered already in Act I v7, but perhaps not in enough detail. 

1, The station in question is a standard research station following the same layout as all such stations. This is part of why the Republic has so many of them, they don't build individual stations but strive to standardize as much as possible to gain scale advantages. The downside is that improvements are slow but new generations of the design comes out every couple of years incorporating new suggestions and various technology improvements. Most of this is backwards compatible meaning stations don't become totally obsolete but are instead always on some kind of reconstruction schedule. An unanticipated upside of this is that legionnaires get a lot of engineering practice helping to upgrade stations and to stay familiar with the current capabilities and layout. The standardized plans also means that it can take time for the station to be fully occupied depending on the type of research and how long it takes to scale up the operation. This combined with the fact that some sections are not as modern or up-to date as the researchers want there are always some unused parts that can be used for legionnaires training. 

The murder takes place in one of these unused sections since this is a perfect place to go to get some peace and quiet and for the legionnaires to train away from the crowded sections. Webb and Miller uses this part for their clandestine meetings since the security is very relaxed due to the unused thing and legionnaires using them for combat and engineering drills. Not everything is in full working order after a few extra welds or projectiles. Active drills are however always announced in advance so no one stumbles on them. 

When Miller finds out Webb shared the stations location she gets angry and attacks Webb who defends himself. After a few shoves Webb pushes Miller hard to get her to back away. She falls and hits her head on a communication station and dies instantly. Webb freaks out and hears the legionnaires coming and just manages to get away before they find the body. Its obvious that there has been a struggle so they call their commander who orders them to lock down the location and calls in Tanaka to take charge since its obviously not a natural death. 

The murder happens around 6 hours before the attack. Enough time to have Tanaka understand the situation and find the location leak in the logs as in the current story. 

2, When Webb is at the station he is part of the communication crew and thus responsible for making sure all equipment is working as it should. This means he has administrative access to station equipment and is enable to add information to outgoing messages. He has installed a routine that automatically add random parts of his messages to outgoing data over a few days. Since all outgoing data is of various lengths the added data disappears in the noise. 

Tanaka finds this out when she examines the consoles in the room where the body was found. She finds that one of the terminals were running an unusual program and when she examines this together with one of the legionnaires with computer security experience they realize what the program does. The program was hidden in the background process but taking up substantial capacity on the terminal since it was splitting a new transmission. If Webb hadn't been disrupted the program would have vanished into the base code an been impossible to find. Tanaka and the legionnaire spends a few hours figuring out the program and what else it has been doing. This is when they find the systematic transmission and manages to find the star-chart pattern and realizes the stations location has been compromised. Before they can make anything of it the proximity alarms go off. 

There is no two-way communication when Webb is on the station. When he leaves the station he signals his handler and there is a dead-drop that Webb checks on his way home. 

Webb realizes his handler betrayed him when he learns about which mercs are boarding. The Firestorm don't take prisoners, its not part of their services or mentality. 

3, Attack duration: around 4 hours
Total time: 
Phase 1: 2 hours
Phase 2: 30 minutes - During this time Adeyemi realizes the shields are an option
Phase 3: A couple of minutes for the actual assault. Then silence for 20 isch minutes while the mercs evaluate their options. When they realize how valuable the shields are they decide to go from contractors to players on their own. Time to stop messing around and kill everyone. They can extract the data when the legionnaires are dead.  
Phase 4: 60 minutes where the centurion fights a delaying action back to the hangar but are taking heavy casualties. One group manages to rig up cargo netting to hold the drones for a while so their fellows can weld the last doors shut. 

Corps/Merc Planning
When handler learns about the artifact it takes him hours to decide to contact the mercs. Channels are already in place to handle artifact retrieval but given that it is a Republic station it takes a while to agree on price. Then its a matter of days to get everything to line up and in place. From there it is a few weeks of travel to the station. This should line up with the transmissions that Tanaka finds in her investigation. So the last message from Webb about the artifact should then be around 3-4 weeks before the attack. 

4, The rushed shield build happens during the assault as the supply convoy approaches the station. 

Chens group get the prototypes from Adeyemi who has taken them from storage during the assault to rescue them together with his research. Putting the prototypes on the soldiers armour is a spur of the moment decision. That the shields have been developed is known, especially with the legionnaires who are abuzz with rumors about their potential in combat. Chen has been consulting with the doctor on how to test and verify them since it overlaps with her combat knowledge. The actual shields have never been tried on anything but drones up until this point though. Its a very desperate gambit. They know the shield field adapts to whatever they apply the shield to and that the shield duration is proportionate to the covered area. But how this translates to covering a human, or what the experience of being inside the field is no one knows. 

5, 
Mercs
- Initial assault 200 troops
- 13 heavy assault suits
- 130 casualties during first phase, mercs are good but legionnaires are fighting on home turf and defending civilians and has booby traps and prepared choke holds everywhere
- All heavy assault suits gets destroyed
- When Firedrones are deployed the mercs are down to 65 troops

Republic
- Full century at station
- Phase 1-2: 23 killed
- No casualties during phase shield assault
- 15 killed when firedrones are deployed as they realize they have no effective counter and starts falling back fast
- 42, including Chen manages to escape. 
- There are already numbers for this in v7, make sure all numbers align 

Staff:
- Look up the numbers from existing v7

6, Webb just goes with the rest of the civilians, he doesn't stand out and Tanaka hasn't had time to share her suspicions with anyone yet. 

Tanaka has Webb on her list from before the attack, but it is first when they are safely away that her investigation begins for real. 

7, Station state is covered in v7 already. As all Republic personnel escapes one stays behind to blow up the station and deny any information to the mercs. This leads to the mercs chasing after the supply convoy and the convoys desperate escape. 

Adeyemi escapes with the artifact and his research. Corps are unsure about where the artifact ends up but mercs sees the artifact with the researchers and knows that it escaped to the republic. Mercs don't care about the artifact but are more interested in the shield research and decides they want to go after it. This is the major action in Act II. There will likely also be a conflict between the mercs and the Corps as the mercs failed to get the artifact and the mercs withhold information about the shields. A breakthrough such as the shields is hard to contain, especially after the enormous success when defending the station. After the shields are used again in Act II the Corps get upset that the Mercs didn't share this information before. Act II needs A LOT of work so these are just rough notes for now!

Since the station blows up there are no merc prisoners and the only physical evidence is the encrypted drive. 

8, Tanaka recognizes the emblems on ships and suits. 

It is not obvious why the Firestorm attacks the station. It is only when Webb breaks down she learns that the artifact was the root of it all. But she doesn't learn why, except that someone is desperate to get their hands on it. 

9, Webb don't know exactly that he was betrayed. He knows the rumors about the Firestorm mercs and during the investigation Tanaka points this out and that it was likely that getting him out alive was not in their brief. Tanaka remembers from briefing that they are more of a shoot first, kill everyone squad rather than to capture high value targets. Webb is in denial about the whole affair since he views himself as master of his fate. During the investigation Tanaka destroys his self-image piece by piece and at last Webb realizes his true worth, someone used him. 

Webb only know about his handler and not anyone else in the network, except that it exists and is big, much bigger than him. Webb knows that the artifact is valuable and sought after, but not why or by whom. Webb tries to deny the murder and claims it was an accident, but as Tanaka decodes more and more of the drive she can confront Webb with more information and he then confesses confronted by overwhelming evidence. 

Tanaka is trained in interrogation but not an expert, the station posting wasn't supposed to include a lot of prisoner interrogations. She is mostly confrontational as she believes the evidence speaks for itself. 

10, I think Act I ends on the ship. 

Act II starts with the convoy returning to a major Republic space port and Webb is handed over for tribunal and Tanaka and Varro reports everything that happened. 

---

Process:
I think maybe try to keep the number of questions to smaller batches, this is a lot to do in one go. 

Please reference and review Act I v7 continuously and refine any further questions based on the existing material. 



# Round 4
Q1, Civilian deaths stay the same with the merc assault as with the Krell. Civilians manage to get to the hangars leaving the legionnaires to take the brunt of the damage. 

I make the total death tool at 38 legionaries and 32 civilians plus Thompsons sacrifice when blowing up the station for a total of 71. This feels more than enough of the 250 total from the station to make everyone feel the loss. Or should we increase the numbers?

Q2, Lets leave the actual blackmail a bit vague. Miller is only alive for one scene which is where she is killed. It can just be a few phrases like she wouldn't be in this situation if Webb hadn't tricked her. Miller helps Webb in the hope that he will honor his promise to get rid of the evidence but then she finds out about the leaked location. 

Q3, Science branch should have been Academic track. The world is still a bit new to me :) Gambling happened years ago by the time the story plays out. The handler helped pay down the debts as Webb got payed for providing him with research papers. Webb believes he is in control and can stop, his ego don't allow for him to see himself as a victim. This makes his eventual break in the interrogations that much harder. 

# Round 5
Q1, Then lets go for 71. 
Q3, Almost correct. The end was supposed to read that Webb believes he is in control and can stop, his ego don't allow for him to see himself as a victim. This makes his eventual break in the interrogations that much harder. 

Batch 2
Q4, Yes, I like that. Lets have a short scene where Miller and Webb mets. Webb has heard about the new shield research and want to know more and presses Miller about it. She then tells him about the artifact and says that Dr Adeyemi had some kind of epiphany after studying it. This gets Webb excited and he presses Miller to get more information about it. 

In the murder scene Miller provides additional data on the artifact and shield research and Webb lets slip that he should have included the shield data in his last update with the location. This is what triggers the reaction, the location leak. 

Q5, Yes, add that scene. During their investigation they see that the program has been active before but then hibernates in the background. This time the program is still running when Tanaka investigates the terminal. If the legionaries hadn't heard the altercation they wouldn't have looked at the room and found the terminals. So yeah, Millers death is what prevented Webb from cleaning up. 

Q6, Webb sees the emblems on the security feeds during the evacuation at the same time as everyone else. Webb panics when he realizes but tries to keep it down, manages to hide it as "regular" panic like everyone else. But others in the group he escapes with notices that he seems more concerned than what is warranted. Its extra strange that his worries don't go away when they are rescued. 

Q7, Yeah, the Krell going away to be replaced by the mercs is a bit of a rewrite :D

They realize they have no good counter, shooting them is hard as they are too many and to small. When they do hit they are faced with an expanding fireball in their direction and there just isn't enough depth in the stations corridors to make this viable. They would need automated sentry guns but those are in storage cut off from them by the mercs. 

The evil thing about the chemical is that it burns especially well when in contact with human flesh, carbon-based. The cargo nets are fine links of stainless steel that tangles the drones and make it hard for them to pass. The net is stretched across a key intersection giving enough breeding room to fall back and prepare. The net don't hold forever and is soon weakened as more and more drones explode and engulf the net in fire. After a couple of minutes it starts melting and the drone can move forward followed by the mercs. 

Swarm sound and blue glow. Like fireflies from hell. 

Q8, A bit of both in the strategy shift. From the legionaries perspective it dont matter, dead is dead. But the mercs presses extra hard with the drones in order to kill everyone and loot the research. Not sure how much of this should actually come across in Act I though. Maybe in Act II we should introduce the merc/Corps perspective. During the assault maybe the legionaries just notice that the mercs seemed to change tactics after they saw the shields being deployed as they too got the combat footage from their assault suits as the legionaries just appeared out of nowhere. 

Q9, Yeah, I like the part about intercepting some of the communication. Perhaps the legionaries combat network automatically records all traffic and during the 4 days after the attack decodes this as part of the after action review. They don't understand what it means by realize that it is important. 

Q10, I like him having some form of self-delusions that makes him rationalize his own greed. He shouldn't really see or understand that he is in the wrong. 

I like you interrogation progression!

Webb don't know he is working for the Corps. In his mind he has made out his handler to be from some kind of Republic corporation, maybe a frontier settlement looking for an edge. Perhaps his handler has let slip clues to this extent, making Webb think he is actually helping a Republic underdog and can look forward to some kind of position there if things work out well. 

Q11, Still uses Aurelius. Coming from a frontier settlement newly part of the Republic looking for an edge. Years into the relationship the artifact angle appears as, be on the lookout for any unusual artifacts, especially if they have a xenoarchaeological origin. They are of interest to special collectors and institutions who are willing to pay good money for them!

# Round 6 (continuing detailed questions)

**BATCH 5: SCENE-SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DETAILS**

Q12, This scene should happen a couple of weeks before the murder. Webb hears about it through station gossip, a breakthrough of this magnitude spreads. This meeting takes place in their usual place. Miller tells him that Adeyemi found something on the planet that lead to new insights resulting in the shields. It not very specific but makes Webb excited when he hears that there is a strange object involved. Maybe it is the type of artifact he has been on the lookout for. 

Q13, Webb is support staff, Miller is on Dr Adeyemis team. Miller gives Webb both data that he copies to the drive and a verbal briefing confirming it is the type of artifact he is after after having looked at its radiation profile. Miller also provides data on the new shield research. 

Q14, Something along the lines of "They'd have paid twice as much if I'd mentioned the shields with the coordinates, that sounds huge!"

Miller freezes and Webb continues talking to himself until Miller shouts "You sent our location!? To whom?". When she doesn't get an immediate response she shoves him to get a reaction and the fight is on. 

Q15, All mentions of the Krell throughout changes to Firestrom Mercs or variations. 

The legionnaires don't know who they are and the one monitoring close space only identifies them as unknown ships. It when they don't respond to hails and launches boarding shuttles that they are designated as hostiles and the alarms sound. 

Q16, The emblem is a black circle with dancing flames coming from a skull. Its on their ships and armor proudly displayed and intended to intimidate the enemy. They also have a full face mask with the logo making it impossible to see individual faces. They are professional soldiers, but believe intimidation tactics give them an edge. 

Regular legionnaires aren't up to date on merc insignia but instantly recognizes them as hostiles and deduces that they are mercs since they don't recognize the markings as those of any known major faction. 

Tanaka however recognizes them right away and briefs Chen that these are not the regular bad guys but real problems. 

Q17, The assault suits are purely mechanical monsters that the operators are fully enclosed in like a full power armor. The suits are 3 meters tall and has both built in weapons as well as the ability to wield ordinary weapon systems, just supersized. 

The legionnaires are professional soldiers and sees a threat as a threat. 

Q18, All merc radio and data traffic within the station is recorder. There is no coverage outside the station. But everything communicated from the ships to the soldiers is caught. Most of the communication is just regular coordination but there is a lot of chatter about the shields and that capturing any research or intelligence on them just became the new mission profile. 

Chen and his squad leaders analyzes this traffic together with ship specialists who helps with the decoding. This is standard practice after all engagements, walk through what happened and how. This is especially important given the new shields and that they actually worked. Their main motive for going through all details in the recording is to understand how the enemy reacted to the shields. 

This is not connected to Tanaka's investigation at all. The mercs were after the artifact and didn't know about the shields. This is part of what makes Webb slip up in the murder scene. But the mercs are smart and instantly sees the value of the shield tech. 

# Round 7

Q19, Lets have Varro's task force arrive just before the attack so that they have some extra time to build the shields. The 35 minutes is a bit tight to be plausible. I think the best story flow would be that the task force is in-system but so far out that they are unable to stop the attack, and in any case they have opted to forgo their legionnaires in favor of carrying the extra equipment that has been requested in one run. 

How do the distances work out? Do we need to factor in light-speed delays in visual observations and communication? I would rather not have to worry about this, but there is the realism perspective that we need to worry about...

Q20, This happens over a few weeks as Adeyemi develops the shield technology. We could have a few scenes where Chen formally helps the Dr in his research lab as well as a more informal conversation in the mess. 

Chen should be optimistic about the tactical possibilities just as you say. But the Adeyemi should be cautious and say that any practical application is still far off. Considering the effect on drones and the communication problems, how would that even work with soldiers who cannot even talk to each other? They also don't know that multiple phased object can see each other while phased. But their discussions gets Chen thinking about non-electronic communication protocols like the hand signals all legionnaires learn in basic training. This then comes back to her when her group phases for the first time and she remembers they cant use radio to coordinate. On the spot she starts using hand-signals to get the group moving and it just works. 

When the legionnaires realize they can't beat the assault suits with the weapons they have on hand one of them says something like, "Damn, if only we could find a way to close with them, our blades would make short work of that armor." This gets Chen thinking and she immediately calls Adeyemi to see if he got any working prototypes out of the lab. And the rest is history as they say :)

Q21, A random civilian notices who approaches Tanaka when he hears that Webb is on the suspect list. Webb keeps asking is they really are safe and seems obsessed with watching the security feeds instead of looking forward to the evacuation. After they have been rescued Webb still seems more afraid than relieved. This could just be explained away with how people react differently. But when the civilian hears about the investigation he talks to Tanaka. "Its probably nothing but Webb seems a bit strange and worried despite the rescue. Kind of like the whole assault was a personal affront instead of just bad luck."

Q22, No one really notices Webb and Miller before, to civilians talking and hanging out is no big deal. What people do in their spare time is their thing. No one sees Webb fleeing the murder scene, the legionnaires here the struggle and then immediately turns to investigate, but the closest way to the noise is through the door they just started welding shut so before they can arrive enough time has elapsed for Webb to make a clean escape. 

Q23, I think the structure still works, lets go with your proposal. 

Q24, The log and the timing is what starts the confession, then it comes piece by piece. There is no physical evidence to speak of other than recordings of the crime scene. Since the station is no more and the attack happened so rapidly there wasn't time to collect anything more and Millers body was still in cold storage when the attack happened. 

Webb is mostly numb and dissociated, he cant really take in that he has been used and discarded. From time to time he tries to still rationalize it by saying it was all a mix up, he didn't mean for this to happen. 

Q25, The main structure still works. The review of combat footage should be worked into the after action review where they analyze the radio traffic. The options to board offensively should just be aired as a thought, "Imagine if this wasn't just a squad in a desperate gamble, but a coordinated effort across a whole ship... But that would require so much more to fall into place....". Then we can continue this line of reasoning in Act II. 

No more scenes of Webb, after he has confessed the last we see of him in Act I should be that he is sent back to confinement. He is not important enough to warrant more time. 

Varros final report should not be directly to the senate but just to Command for now. It should include a full summary of everything that is know at the moment Act I ends. 

Tanaka should have a strong desire to continue the investigation, but needs to consult with Intelligence HQ about the way forward. 

The emotional tone should be hopeful but with an undertone of wanting revenge for those who have fallen and answers about why together with a determination to get those answers. 

Q26, Tanaka knows nothing about Handlers identity or anything about the network. There are more questions than answers but Tanaka hopes that Intelligence HQ can help shed some light on this now that she has a clear connection to the artifact. 

I like the final line! :D


# Round 8
Q27, Lets go with option B. But lets not go crazy about the physics, it should be acknowledged and respected. But I don't want to confuse readers with too much math and I don't feel being overly concerned with these kind of details adds that much to the story. 

Q28, Lets have the construction take longer. The focus should be on them adapting a drone prototype to shuttle scale with all the adaption that require instead of them being superhumanly fast. 

The conference call should happen when the station realizes that there is an attack coming. No one would assault a station without being confident in their ability to succeed. 

Q29, The scenes should be before the murder as part of the introduction to the world and the setting and might be a good way to introduce Chen. Then we can have short flashbacks during combat to reinforce and frame the upcoming decisions. 

Chen provides tactical analysis of the shields and might be the one who actually calls the technology a shield. Dr Adeyemi might be focused solely on the fact that there is a field that does something. Chen might help out with trying to locate the shielded object with some kind of combat scanner and when she cant she blurts out something like "Dr, I know the drone is there, I just saw it when the field activated and from experience I know it will be there when the power runs out. But my scanner tells me nothing, its like it just vanished. Imagine if our camouflage would work like this. But then this is more than camouflage, it cant be interacted with. Its more like a shield from my wildest dreams come true." After this they call the field effect a Phase Shield. 

It definitely needs to be a scene!

Q30, This should also be scene. A few weeks before the attack. Focus should be on the communication problem and how they cannot get any readings while the drone is in the field. They shouldn't talk about psychological effects yet, that is something that should come as a total surprise. Testing on drones doesn't give them any clues about this. This scene is also good for establishing the characters a bit more and give them a bit of depth. 

Q31, Let's make it a random legionnaire, someone who is close to Chen when the assault suits starts to advance. The comment should come after the suits appears with massive blast shields in front of them and shoulder guns firing. The legionnaires hand weapons doesn't even scratch the heavy shields. Chen's reaction is perfect in your example. 

Q32, It should be a full scene, but a short one and they shouldn't be mentioned by name. Webb's lines are good and Miller should be reluctant to comply as she feels it has gone too far. She agrees to do it, but only if this is the last time. 

Q33, The scene should be fully detailed, your structure seems perfect!

Q34, I would say keep it as is, just change the bad guys. 

Q35, The civilian deaths shouldn't be focused on too much. Most of them die in the scramble to reach the hangars as the mercs board the station. Those who die are mostly in sections without easy access to the hangars and has to go through the mercs, none of these make it. We don't go into details, just not that when we count the people in the hangar, some of them are lost and there is no chance to go look for them. 

We can do quick mentions for some deaths but lets not go out of our way to include them. 

No mention of any civilians by name when they die. Not sure about the memorial though. It would be strange to just name a few and not all. Probably best to summarize that all names were read and remembered. 


# Round 9

Q36, Lets keep the pods escaping!

Q37, They cram all civilians into the shielded shuttles, the legionnaires push them in. Yes, its a bit brutal and more than likely there will be a few broken bones, but the alternative is certain death for those who stay or being part of an extremely dangerous decoy maneuver on the unshielded shuttles. So the legionnaires are not gentle about saving them, but they would rather have an angry scientist than a dead scientist on their conscience. 

21 bodies left behind makes sense, the legionnaires place body recovery high on their duty to the fallen, but placing themselves at risk only adds to the problem. So some are left behind. Its something that those who survive struggle with in addition to the regular survival guilt. 

But lets not have any legionnaires on external hardpoints or anything silly like that. Everyone, including the bodies inside the shuttles!

Q38, Lets go with your proposal for now. I need to read it to see how it flows. 

Q39,  Lets have some of it show up in the interrogations and as Torres is able to decode the files. We don't need to show everything here. I think it is enough for now to hint that there has been things going on for a while. 

Q40, Show passage of time through actions and short comments like in you example. Maybe something like one of the legionnaires catching their breath and looking at a watch and realizes this had been their first actual combat and that it felt like hours had passed while in reality it had only been 30 minutes. This way we can show that the assault progresses over time without having to mark it explicitly. 

Q41, The legionnaires don't question the miracle but right away tends their wounded and hauls them to the hangar while others reinforce their positions. Some urge the civilians trapped with them along and make sure everyone gets back to the extraction point. 

The legionnaires observe how the mercs fall back and how their radio chatter starts to change. Soon they see mercs bringing out crates where some cameras still are working. The silence feels ominous and some legionnaires get itchy and comments that maybe they got scared after seeing how effective the shields were. Chen's combat instinct tells her no, something is coming. Then they see how the crates open up and a blue light emerges, soon after they here the buzzing of drones. 

Q42, I like option A, but with a twist of C. But I think Webb can rationalize away Millers death to some extent. But the realization that he was supposed to be killed in the attack is what pushes him over. 

Q43, The realization fits best with the feeling I'm going for. 

Q44, Damn, I mixed this character up... Good catch! Lets keep Chen male!

Q45, It should be Stellar Republic or Republic for short. All mentions of the confederation and its variants has to go!

Q46, I think this should play out around day 3, after the memorials. Try to combine them and then I can see how well it works. There are so many changes by now its a bit hard to keep track of everything :)
