So there are a number of things I want to go over when it comes to the Stellar Republics military structure. I do not have a military background so I really am not an expert but I want it to feel like the military branch has a credible structure to it. 

# Total army
First I want to look at the number of active army. I think we have a huge problem with then numbers across all branches, but lets start with the Legions. Current document says we have around 1,3 million active military for almost 280 billion people liviing in the Republic. This gives around 0.00046% which is insanely low. 

We also now do not make a good distinction between the fleet and legions. 

The republic is made up of 42 start systems across 12 regions. I think each region should act as a base for the military. The overall military of the Republic is made up of around 0.1% of the total population for a total number of 280 million. This is then further divided into roughly 60% being auxiliary (168 000 000) and the rest (112 000 000) federal. Dividing this into the 12 regions gives us around 14 million auxiliary and 9 million for the federal. 

## Auxiliarys
Auxiliary forces are responsible for home and near home planet defense with the federal responsible for interstellar security and all federal installations not belonging to specific star systems but being common assets. Auxiliary forces are the responsibility of the individual star system to raise and organize, the republic mandates numbers and supervises training but it is to a very large extent the concern of the star system. 

## Federal
The federal force is made up of the fleet and the legions in roughly equal parts. Fleet is responsible for the ships to make sure the legions can get to where they need to be. Legions make up all frontline troops and serve as security forces for all federal installations. The Legions rely on the auxiliarys for any major ground engagement. 


# Legion structure
Each legion has the following specilisations: 
* Marine Corps - 60%
    * Ship boarding and capture
    * Station assault and defense
    * Close-quarters combat specialists
    * Zero-G warfare experts
    * Rapid response to emergencies

* Support Services - 30%
    * Logistics and supply chain
    * Maintenance and repair
    * Medical services (combat medicine)
    * Intelligence and reconnaissance
    
* Special Operations - 5%
    * Deep reconnaissance
    * Unconventional warfare
    * Direct action missions
    * Sensitive political operations

* Command/Staff -  5%
    * Strategic planning
    * Operations coordination
    * Training and doctrine development
    * Administrative support
    * Officers and senior NCOs

The Marine section is where the Legionaries are and this is the core element of each legion. Every legion is made up of 10 cohorts with the first cohort being twice as big as the rest. Each cohort is made up of 6 centurys of 100 legionaries each with the first cohort having 200 legionaries in each century. 

Every century is commanded by a centurion which is a commissioned officer rank. Cohort 10 is commanded by the newest and lowest ranked centurions and cohort 1 is commanded by the highest ranking centurions. Within each cohort the first century is of higher rank than the last. This rank structure is very simple and simply states centurion and then the cohort and century. Centurion 1-1 is the rank for the first century in the first cohort and 10-6 is the sixths century in the tenth cohort. It is not mandatory to advance through each rank sequntialyl. 

I'm not very happy with the numbering schema above, it is a bit to artifical and I would much rather have something along these lines:

1. **Pilus Prior** ("First Spear") - Cohort commander, most senior
2. **Princeps Prior** ("First Leader")
3. **Hastatus Prior** ("First Spearman")
4. **Pilus Posterior** ("Second Spear")
5. **Princeps Posterior** ("Second Leader")
6. **Hastatus Posterior** ("Second Spearman") - Most junior

Every centution has one Optio for every 50 men he is responsible for. The Optio serves a second in command and is an NCO rank responsible for training and implemention order from the Centurion. 

All centuries are made up of squads of 10 soldiers with a Decanus as squad leader which is also an NCO rank. 

Every cohort has a dedicated commander in addition to the centurion. 

The legion as a whole as a dedicated commander. 

This gives the following structure for the Legionaries in a Legion:

Legion commander: 1
Cohort commanders: 10
Centurions: 60
Optios: 132
Decanus: 660
Legionnaries: 6600
Total: 7463 

In addition to these numbers are the Support services and Special Operations function as well ass Command/Staff. 

## Number of legions
If each legion is made up of rougly 12500 soldiers, there needs to be around 373 legions per region. 

**For Claude:**
This is a stupidly large number. How do we make this manageable? Combine legions into larger blocks that are easier to reason about? Or just make everything in the legions larger? Or make the republic smaller? Or is it actually a good number?

Am I missing something essential when it comes to organize and structure the military? I have no experience at all with this and it shows...

# Fleet structure
Something similiar to the above, based on the Fleet and Ships document. Sized adequatley to safely get the legionaries to where they need to go and support them when they are there. 

Of course also structured and capable enough to act against other fleets and to space-only missions such as fleet on fleet actions without real legionary elements. Although as a rule legionnaries are always based on ships to be able to board enemy ships and repell borders. 

The brunt of the legionaries however are bunked on dedicated assault transports and similar.  

# Service Experience
**For Claude:** Base this on the vigiles document since this is very fleshed out, but make sure to align with this document and the existing Stellar Legion branch. 

All federal military go through the same service track. 

* Year 1, Basic training
* Year 2, Specilization training
* Year 3-8, Active Service

 When entering Active service Decanus and Optio positions are assigned based on training results. 

 After the mandated service period those who want to stay can be commisioned as centurions and start climbing the century ladder in order to reach higher command. Starting century position is based on results so far. 

 Outstanding legionnaries can be promoted to entry level centurion position after year 6. 

 Those who want to stay can also chose other specialised roles in addition to becoming officers. Both support services and special operations are made up of career soldiers.

Lets embrace the scale!

After doing some more math, these are the new numbers I have. 

Legion numbers stay the same for now. 

Legion commander: 1
Cohort commanders: 10
Centurions: 60
Optios: 132
Decanus: 660
Legionnaries: 6600
Total: 7463 

Based on the individual components below:

* Marine Corps - 55%
* Support Services - 15%
* Special Operations - 5%
* Command/Staff -  5%

This gives us a total legion size of around 11.000. 

The total federal military is 112 million. And instead of roughly equal, lets have this be 20/80 fleet/legions for toal numbers of:
* Fleet 22,4 million
* Legions: 89,6 million

Divided again for the regions we get
* Fleet ~1,9 million
* Legions: ~7,5 million
    * Admin: 5% ~370.000
