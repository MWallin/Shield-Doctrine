# Service Branches Document - Inconsistencies Found

**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Reviewed Document:** The Stellar Republic - Service Branches.md
**Cross-referenced with:** Fleet and Ships.md, Citizenship.md

## 1. MAJOR: Hospital Ships Count Mismatch

**Location:** Service Branches.md, line 219

**Issue:**
- **Service Branches document** states: "Hospital Ships (30 in active service)"
- **Fleet and Ships document** states: "HOSPITAL SHIP CLASS (70 in service, 1 per Legion)"

**Analysis:**
Since there are 70 Stellar Legions and the Fleet document specifies "1 per Legion," the correct number should be 70 hospital ships, not 30.

**Recommendation:**
Update Service Branches.md line 219 to read "Hospital Ships (70 in active service)"

## 2. MODERATE: Full Citizenship Path for Stellar Legions Unclear

**Location:** Service Branches.md, line 806

**Issue:**
Current text reads:
> "After 10 Years: Automatic Resident Citizenship (8 years) or Full Citizenship (10 years with good record and examination)"

This makes it sound like anyone serving 10 years in the Legions automatically gets Full Citizenship, but this is only true for the **officer track**.

**According to Citizenship.md:**
- **Option 1 (Standard/Enlisted)**: 12 years total service (8 years → Resident Citizenship, then 4 more → Full Citizenship)
- **Option 2 (Officer Track)**: 10 years total service (4 years Federal Academy + 6 years officer service → Full Citizenship)

**Analysis:**
The "10 years to Full Citizenship" advantage only applies to Federal Academy graduates who become officers. Enlisted personnel still need 12 years total.

**Recommendation:**
Clarify the text to distinguish between enlisted and officer tracks:
- Enlisted: 8 years → Resident Citizenship, 12 years total → Full Citizenship
- Officer Track (Federal Academy): 10 years total → Full Citizenship

## 3. MODERATE: Service Experience Doesn't Distinguish Officer vs Enlisted Tracks

**Location:** Service Branches.md, lines 763-809

**Issue:**
The "Service Experience" section describes a single progression that combines both enlisted and officer tracks:
- Years 1-2: Basic Training and Specialty School
- Years 3-6: Enlisted / Junior Officer Service
- Years 7-10: Senior Enlisted / Mid-Grade Officers

This conflates two fundamentally different career paths.

**Should be two distinct paths:**

**Enlisted Track:**
- Ages 18-20: Basic Combat Training (6 months) + Specialty School (12-18 months)
- Ages 20-28: 8 years enlisted service → Resident Citizenship
- Ages 28-32: 4 more years → Full Citizenship (12 years total)

**Officer Track:**
- Ages 18-22: Federal Academy (4 years)
- Ages 22-28: 6 years as commissioned officer → Full Citizenship (10 years total)

**Analysis:**
While the section mentions "Officers (Federal Academy graduates)" it doesn't clearly separate these career paths, leading to confusion about timelines and citizenship requirements.

**Recommendation:**
Restructure the "Service Experience" section to have two clear subsections:
1. "Enlisted Service Path"
2. "Officer Service Path (Federal Academy)"

## 4. MINOR: Civic Administration Percentage Inconsistency

**Location:** Service Branches.md, lines 548 and 571

**Issue:**
- Line 548 (Three Major Divisions): "2. Justice System (~30%)"
- Line 571 (Service Specializations): "Judicial Services (~25%)"

**Analysis:**
Are these meant to be the same thing with different percentages? If so, which is correct? Or is there a 5% difference that should be explained (perhaps some justice personnel in other categories)?

**Recommendation:**
Either:
1. Make both percentages consistent (probably 30%), OR
2. Explain what the 5% difference represents

## 5. MINOR: Combat Medic Training Duration Needs Clarification

**Location:** Service Branches.md, line 312

**Issue:**
Text states: "Combat medics (6-month accelerated training) in every century"

This is very short compared to Medical Service's "Years 1-2 (Medical Academy): Intensive education in human biology, anatomy, physiology..."

**Questions:**
- Are combat medics Medical Service personnel who receive additional combat training?
- OR are they Legion personnel who receive basic combat first aid (not full medical training)?
- What level of medical care can they actually provide?

**Analysis:**
The relationship between Medical Service and combat medics needs clarification. A 6-month course is not enough to create physicians, so these are likely:
- Medical Service personnel deployed with Legions, OR
- Legion personnel trained as advanced first responders (like military corpsmen/medics)

**Recommendation:**
Add a brief explanation of what combat medics are:
- Their relationship to Medical Service
- What their 6-month training actually prepares them to do
- How they differ from Medical Service physicians

## Priority Summary

**MUST FIX:**
1. Hospital ships count (30 → 70)
2. Clarify 10-year citizenship is officer track only

**SHOULD FIX:**
3. Separate enlisted vs officer service paths clearly
4. Resolve Justice System percentage inconsistency

**NICE TO FIX:**
5. Clarify combat medic training and role

## Notes

These inconsistencies don't break the worldbuilding but do create confusion about:
- Resource allocation (hospital ships)
- Citizenship pathways (major selling point of service)
- Career progression (how people advance)

The biggest impact is on understanding the incentive structure for joining different branches and career tracks.
