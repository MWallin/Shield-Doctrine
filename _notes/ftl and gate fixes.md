# Round 1

## 1, The Light-Year Threshold
I wanted to build this communication on something that is known and familiar, but also give an explanation as to why this technology want already developed on earth. Having a minimum distance explains why all the puzzle pieces are there, but they still refuse to fit. 

So I want the tech to be "turned on" at exactly 1 LY and below this it doesn't work at all, no gradient, just off. 

Lets go with something like your suggestions but framed as the particles are interacting with spacetime curvature in such a way that the magnetic field changes are cancelled out. Spacetime curvature seems to have some kind of wave form pattern on the scale of 1 LY that interacts with entangled particles in a way that is difficult to understand but readily available to observe. The republic has yet to formulate a complete scientific rationale for this. 

Yeah, this feels a bit absurd, so please help me formulate this in as credible a way as possible!

## 2, Hypergate directions
Lets get rid of the bidirectional gates, they were a good idea, but they complicate things for very little return. 

Since gates are built on top of entangled particles, its the particles that decide in which direction the gates go. 

## 3, Gate cooldown
I'm not really following what the problem is, but I trust you have found something. 

Make a fix that is within the spirit of the existing text. 

## 4, Republic gate power
I got a bit scared of the big numbers. But you are right, lets go with the higher cost. Civilization level assets are absurdly expensive. But also absurdly powerful. 

This can also give us nice incentives further on to go find more advanced power sources in a story somewhere. 

## 5, ZPEEs
Cut them. It felt cool when I first wrote about them, but we are stretching things as it is. 

## 6, The monopoly
Lets go with all your suggested fixes except the resource monopoly. Also, space is big, everything is going to be abundant somewhere. 

My thinking here was that the science of how entangled particles work isn't the same as the blueprint for the facilities to make them. So free sharing of hard science, but don't give everyone detailed instructions for how to catch up. But yeah, the parallell to nuclear weapons is good. Anyone who understands the science can build them, but going from one pair of entangled particles in a communication array to gates connecting all major systems is a big step. 

## 7, Timeline
I think something got a bit messed up here. 

The original idea was that when the colony ships left earth, the brought a lot of experimental tech with them, one such thing was a batch of entangled particles. Some of these particles started receiving data from earth once the colony ships crossed the 1 LY threshold. This is when the science finally clicked for the on-board researchers who sent this data back to earth on probes. No one wanted to go back with the data and explain things and as of yet, no response has been heard from earth even though some particles should be available for controlled communication. The original researches set up all particles that they had for sending data back to earth, but they don't know if anyone is listening. 

## 8, In-system FTL relay
I'm not sure I like this very much now that I think about it. But given how the tech work I think this is kind of inevitable. Help me figure out if we can keep this or if the omission just seems strange.
