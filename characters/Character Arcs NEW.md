# Shield Doctrine - Character Arcs

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Purpose:** Track how major characters change and grow across the trilogy

---

## What This Document Is For

This document tracks **character development arcs** across all three acts. It helps you:

- **Plan character growth** - Where do characters start and end?
- **Ensure satisfying arcs** - Do characters change meaningfully?
- **Prevent static characters** - Everyone should grow
- **Track transformation** - How does each act change them?
- **Coordinate arcs** - How do character arcs interact?

---

## Why This Matters

Without arc tracking:
- ❌ Characters feel static (same person in Act I as Act III)
- ❌ Growth feels random (no clear progression)
- ❌ Arcs get forgotten (start development, drop it)
- ❌ Multiple characters have same arc (boring)

With arc tracking:
- ✅ Clear progression (Act I → II → III growth)
- ✅ Satisfying transformation
- ✅ Each character has distinct arc
- ✅ Arcs complement themes

---

## Character Arc Template

For each major character, track:

### **Starting Point (Act I Beginning)**
- Who are they at the start?
- What are their beliefs, skills, weaknesses?
- What do they want?

### **Act I Development**

- What do they learn?
- How do they change?

### **Act I Endpoint**

## How to Use This Document

1. **Fill in starting points** for all major characters
2. **Track development** as you write/revise each act
