# Shield Doctrine - Character Relationships

**Status:** NEW - Template ready for completion
**Purpose:** Map connections between characters and how relationships evolve

---

## What This Document Is For

This document maps **relationships between characters** and tracks how they change across the trilogy. It helps you:

- **Track connections** - Who knows who? How?
- **Show relationship evolution** - How do connections deepen/change?
- **Create realistic networks** - People know people who know people
- **Avoid orphaned characters** - Everyone connects somehow
- **Build emotional stakes** - Relationships make us care

---

## Why This Matters

Without relationship tracking:
- ❌ Characters feel isolated (no connections)
- ❌ Relationships appear randomly (no history)
- ❌ Evolution feels unearned (strangers → best friends overnight)
- ❌ Missed opportunities (interesting connections never explored)

With relationship tracking:
- ✅ Believable social networks
- ✅ Relationship progression feels earned
- ✅ Emotional moments land (we care about connections)
- ✅ Story feels richer (characters have history)
