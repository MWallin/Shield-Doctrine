# Shield Doctrine - Project Guide

## Project Identity & Purpose

**Shield Doctrine** is a military science fiction trilogy set in a Roman-inspired stellar republic in 2750 CE. The story focuses on professional competence, earned citizenship, and infrastructure as the foundation of civilization.

**Current Development Status:** Story v5 with comprehensive Roman principles integration

**Genre:** Hard military sci-fi with emphasis on tactical realism and professional competence

## Hard Constraints (Cannot Violate)

### Timeline
- **2150 CE:** Humanity's exodus from Earth (asteroid threat)
- **2150-2400 CE:** Diaspora period, colony establishment
- **2400-2550 CE:** Emergence of stellar nations
- **2550-2600 CE:** Confederation formation
- **2745 CE:** Confederation captures Krell vessels, begins reverse-engineering jump drives
- **2750 CE:** Shield Doctrine trilogy main events
  - Obsidian Station attack (Year 0)
  - Typhon battle (6 weeks later)
  - Hammerfall (16 months after Typhon)

### Physics & Technology Hard Limits

**Faster-Than-Light Travel:**
- Jump drives ONLY (spatial compression, not wormholes)
- Requires massive energy (scales exponentially with distance)
- Calculation time vs. accuracy trade-off is fundamental
- Cannot jump near massive gravitational sources safely
- **NO FTL communication possible**

**Phase-Variance Shields:**
- Duration limited by power and psychological factors
- **Cannot communicate electronically while phased**
- Objects must be in physical contact to remain phased together
- Phased objects cannot interact with normal matter
- Recently discovered technology (discovered at Obsidian Station, 2750 CE)

**Jump Drives:**
- Recently acquired from Krell (2745 CE)
- Confederation still mastering the technology
- Creates strategic vulnerability (limited operational range)

### Military Organization (Roman Terms)
- **Century:** 80 legionaries
- **Cohort:** Multiple centuries
- **Legion:** Multiple cohorts
- **Centurion:** Century commander (typically 15+ years experience)
- **Primus Pilus:** Senior centurion, second-in-command
- **Gladius:** Ceremonial and practical close-quarters weapon (molecular-edge, vibration field)

## Core Themes (Must Be Present)

### 1. Professional Competence Overcomes Adversity
- Success comes from training, experience, adaptation, and professional excellence
- **No narrative shortcuts, luck, or special powers**
- Characters succeed because they're good at what they do
- Failures happen due to genuine difficulty, not character stupidity
- Creates satisfying "competence porn" where readers watch professionals excel

**Roman Connection:** Roman military success came from systematic training, professional development, and institutional learning—not individual heroics.

### 2. Earned Citizenship Creates Stakeholder Society
- Political rights come through service
- Graduated tiers acknowledge contributions incrementally
- **Tiered System:** Civic Participant (2 years) → Regional Citizen (4 years) → Federal Citizen (6 years)
- Creates stakeholders invested in the system's success

**Roman Connection:** Roman citizenship was a strategic weapon transforming conquered enemies into stakeholders. Graduated citizenship (Latini, civitas sine suffragio, full citizenship) created multiple levels of belonging.

### 3. Infrastructure as Foundation of Civilization
- Roads, aqueducts, communication networks enable prosperity
- Infrastructure investment creates long-term strategic advantage
- Engineering excellence matters as much as military prowess

**Roman Connection:** Roman roads, aqueducts, and fortifications enabled both military control and economic prosperity for centuries.

## Writing Style Requirements

### Tone & Approach
- **Technical accuracy matters** (engineering, military tactics, physics)
- Show systematic adaptation and institutional learning
- Characters succeed through skill, training, and adaptation
- After-action reviews and doctrine refinement are part of the culture
- Respect the intelligence of both characters and readers

### What to Avoid
- Narrative shortcuts or deus ex machina solutions
- Characters making stupid decisions to create drama
- Technology working inconsistently for plot convenience
- Individual "chosen one" heroics over professional teamwork
- Ignoring established constraints for convenience

### What to Emphasize
- Combined arms integration (boarding specialists + engineers + support)
- Systematic problem-solving and iterative improvement
- Professional military culture and traditions
- Engineering challenges solved through expertise under pressure
- Tactical innovation within established constraints

## Roman Integration Principles

### Military (Well Established)
- Professional volunteer military (6-year service minimum)
- Career progression based on merit and experience
- Combined arms doctrine
- Systematic after-action reviews
- Adaptation of enemy technologies
- Gladius as symbol of legionary tradition

### Civic (Needs Strengthening)
- Citizenship through service model
- Senate deliberation and debate
- Provincial governance structures
- Infrastructure as state priority
- Public works and engineering culture

### Cultural (Opportunities for Development)
- Values transmission through formal education
- Ancestor veneration and family traditions
- Public ceremonies and rituals
- Engineering as prestige profession
- Service ethos embedded in culture

## Common Collaboration Tasks

### Story Development
1. Check current v5 files in `chapters/`
2. Reference corresponding Improvements docs for analysis
3. Verify consistency with Worldbuilding Consistency Guide
4. Check Roman Principles Integration Guide for opportunities

### Character Work
1. Maintain consistency with `characters/Key Characters.md`
2. Ensure character actions reflect professional competence
3. Show growth through experience and adaptation
4. Respect established backgrounds and motivations

### Technology & Worldbuilding
1. **Must align with Consistency Guide constraints**
2. Check `world-building/Key Technology.md` for established systems
3. Ensure new tech doesn't violate hard physics limits
4. Consider strategic/tactical implications of any changes

### Roman Elements
1. Reference Integration Guide for gaps and opportunities
2. Consider both military and civic applications
3. Ensure historical parallels enhance rather than constrain story
4. Balance authenticity with narrative needs

## Version Control Notes

- **v5 is current** - Earlier versions retained for reference only
- Check git status for active work areas
- Modified files indicate ongoing development focus
- Untracked folders (`_notes/`, `_process/`) are working directories

## Key Story Beats (Spoiler Warning)

**Act I - Obsidian Station:**
- Dr. Adeyemi discovers phase-variance shields from mysterious artifact
- Krell attack station (someone leaked intel)
- Centurion Chen's century holds the line while researchers evacuate
- Torres improvises working shields in 14 minutes
- Varro makes emergency jump with incomplete calculations

**Act II - Typhon:**
- 6 weeks of systematic training and doctrine development
- Mathematical breakthrough: phase-shields and jump drives share underlying principles
- Security investigation reveals citizenship system created insider threat (Webb)
- Battle of Typhon: VLC (Very Low Confidence jump) + phase-shield tactics succeed

**Act III - Hammerfall:**
- 16 months later: Confederation strikes back at Krell
- Ambitious multi-fleet operation with incomplete preparation
- Phase-anchor technology fails at critical moment
- Professional adaptation and improvisation secure victory despite setbacks
- Citizenship reforms implemented based on lessons learned
