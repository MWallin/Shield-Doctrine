### ⚠️ CITIZENSHIP PATHWAYS - MINOR ISSUE

**Required Elements (from updated framework):**

- Full Citizenship: Two paths only
  - Path 1: Extended Service (12 years total)
  - Path 2: Exceptional Contribution (variable, rare)
- NO Officer Track

**Vigiles Implementation:**
- Resident Citizenship: 8 years automatic ✓

  - Plus examination requirement
- Exceptional Contribution path not mentioned (though this is rare, so may be acceptable omission)

**Recommendation:**
Add a brief section explicitly stating the Full Citizenship pathway:
- After 8 years: Resident Citizenship (automatic)

- (Optional: mention Exceptional Contribution path exists but is rare)

### EXCELLENT FEATURES TO PRESERVE:

1. **Three detailed examples** (small town, city, station) - keep these!
2. **Extensive cultural traditions** - shows depth of branch culture
3. **Integration section** - thorough coverage of all branch relationships
4. **"Everyday heroes" identity** - compelling and distinct
5. **Civilian-military distinction** - emphasized throughout

## Conclusion
