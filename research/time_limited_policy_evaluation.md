# Time-Limited Policy Evaluation by Censors: Evidence-Based Governance in the Stellar Republic

The Stellar Republic's proposed system—requiring all major policies to include defined timeframes, quantifiable success metrics, and active renewal decisions by independent Censors—would represent **authentically Roman institutional design adapted for evidence-based governance**. But achieving this requires balancing the moral authority Roman censors possessed with modern understanding of metric manipulation, institutional capture, and the failures of purely technocratic evaluation.

This document examines how the Roman censorship model can be adapted for policy evaluation, draws on real-world evidence from Texas sunset laws to UK "What Works" institutions, analyzes the critical challenge of Goodhart's Law (metric gaming), and provides specific recommendations for creating Censors who possess both technical competence and moral authority.

## Roman censorship: Moral authority with institutional limits

The Roman censors held the office of **highest dignity after the dictatorship**—described by Plutarch as a "sacred magistracy" (*templum*) reserved almost exclusively for former consuls as the crowning achievement of the *cursus honorum*. Their power derived not from military force (*imperium*) but from moral authority (*auctoritas*) earned through decades of demonstrated virtue in public service.

### The three core duties

**Census taking**: Every five years, censors conducted a comprehensive registration of all citizens, their property, and their social class. This wasn't mere bookkeeping—the census determined voting rights, military service obligations, and tax liabilities. Citizens swore oaths about their declarations; falsification was punishable by death. The census created the authoritative record of who belonged to the Republic and at what level.

**Senate revision (*lectio senatus*)**: Censors reviewed and revised Senate membership, determining which former magistrates retained senatorial dignity. They could remove senators for serious moral failings, financial misconduct, or conduct "unbecoming" of senatorial status. In 184 BCE, Cato the Censor expelled seven senators including a former consul, demonstrating that even the highest prior achievement didn't protect against censorial judgment.

**Moral supervision (*regimen morum*)**: The censors' broadest and most feared power—general supervision of citizen conduct and public morals. They could issue the *nota censoria*, a formal mark of censure that:
- Excluded citizens from their voting tribes (losing political rights)
- Stripped equestrian status (losing social rank and financial privileges)
- Reduced senators to commoner status
- Attached permanent stigma to a citizen's reputation

Cato's censorship (184 BCE) exemplified this power's severity. He expelled senators for inappropriate conduct, removed a senator for kissing his wife in public daytime (considered indecent), imposed heavy luxury taxes on expensive goods, and **faced 44 prosecutions after leaving office** due to the enemies he made. Despite this opposition, his judgments stood because they were perceived as motivated by principle rather than personal vendetta.

### Institutional checks preventing tyranny

Roman institutional design prevented censors from becoming tyrants through multiple constraints:

**Collegiality**: Two censors served jointly; either could block the other. Disagreement between censors prevented action, requiring consensus for major decisions. This prevented individual excess while ensuring decisions had support from at least two respected figures.

**Limited term**: 18-month terms (uniquely long for Roman offices but still finite) prevented entrenchment. Censors knew their authority was temporary, creating incentives to act based on principle rather than building political machines.

**Successor revision**: Later censors could reverse predecessors' judgments. The *nota censoria* wasn't permanent and irreversible; subsequent censors might restore status if circumstances changed or original judgment seemed excessive. This created accountability across censorial generations.

**No imperium**: Censors lacked military command authority and couldn't use force. Their power was purely social and administrative—they could stigmatize but not imprison, fine but not execute (except through due process for census fraud).

**Required justification**: The *subscriptio censoria* required written explanation for punishments, creating permanent records subject to public scrutiny and later review.

**Legislative oversight**: The *Lex Clodia* (58 BCE) eventually required formal hearings before senators could be removed, showing how institutional constraints evolved to balance censorial power against individual rights.

**Political consequences**: Censors served at the pinnacle of their careers but still faced political accountability. Cato faced 44 prosecutions; others faced social ostracism or electoral defeat when seeking subsequent offices. Excessive severity damaged reputation even if technically within authority.

This system created powerful oversight while preventing dictatorship: censors could judge conduct and impose stigma, but they operated within institutional frameworks requiring consensus, justification, and acceptance of reversal by successors.

### The critical distinction: Judgment versus technocracy

Roman censors derived authority from **demonstrated virtue** over long careers, not technical expertise in policy analysis. A former consul who had commanded legions, governed provinces, and served in multiple magistracies possessed *auctoritas*—weight of judgment earned through experience. Citizens trusted censorial decisions not because censors used sophisticated metrics but because they had proven their own character through decades of public service.

This creates tension with modern evidence-based policymaking, which emphasizes data analysis, quantifiable metrics, and technical expertise over moral judgment. The Stellar Republic must integrate both sources of authority: Censors need technical competence to evaluate complex policies but also moral standing that makes their judgments culturally authoritative. Purely technocratic evaluation lacks legitimacy; purely moral judgment lacks rigor. The system requires both.

## Texas sunset laws: Automatic review at scale

Since 1977, the **Texas Sunset Advisory Commission** has reviewed approximately 80% of state government—demonstrating that systematic policy review is logistically feasible even in large bureaucracies. The commission has generated approximately **$1 billion in documented savings** while abolishing 95 agencies (42 completely eliminated, 53 consolidated into other entities).

### How the system actually works

**Automatic abolition schedule**: State agencies face review on a **12-year cycle** with automatic termination if the legislature doesn't pass a continuation bill. This isn't theoretical—agencies actually terminate if continuation fails. In 2009, the legislature adjourned without renewing the Texas Department of Transportation (the state's largest agency), forcing an emergency special session.

**Commission structure**: 12 members serve with staggered terms:
- 5 senators appointed by Lieutenant Governor
- 5 representatives appointed by Speaker
- 2 public members jointly appointed by legislative leadership

Bipartisan composition is baked into the structure—appointments come from both parties, preventing single-party capture.

**Review process**: The commission evaluates 20-30 agencies per two-year legislative cycle through:
1. Staff investigation (examining budgets, operations, effectiveness, complaints)
2. Public hearings (stakeholders, agency staff, affected citizens testify)
3. Site visits to agency facilities
4. Document review (including privileged materials—the commission can access internal communications)
5. Recommendation development (continue unchanged, continue with modifications, consolidate, or abolish)

Staff possess substantial investigative authority: they can attend closed agency meetings, review privileged materials not available to the public, and issue subpoenas if agencies refuse cooperation.

**Legislative action**: The commission issues reports with recommendations. The legislature then votes on agency continuation. Since 2001, the legislature has implemented **80% of statutory recommendations**, reaching **95% implementation in the 2023 session**. This high implementation rate indicates the commission's analysis carries substantial weight with legislators.

**Documented outcomes**:
- 42 agencies completely abolished
- 53 agencies consolidated into others
- Approximately $1 billion in documented savings
- Every dollar spent on Sunset review returns approximately $16-21 in savings or revenue gains
- Numerous cases of improved accountability, reduced duplication, and streamlined regulation

### Critical failures and limitations

Despite successes, Texas sunset laws reveal serious limitations:

**Emergency failures**: When the legislature failed to renew the Department of Transportation in 2009, essential road maintenance and traffic safety programs faced termination. The emergency special session cost substantial money and created administrative chaos—demonstrating that automatic termination without adequate preparation causes more problems than it solves for truly essential functions.

**Reorganization bias**: Critics argue the commission rarely recommends outright abolition for major agencies, instead proposing reorganization or modest reforms. Of 95 agencies affected, most were "small, relatively insignificant" according to analysis. Large agencies with powerful stakeholders and substantial budgets face tough scrutiny but usually continue with modifications rather than termination.

**Political pressure**: Agency stakeholders—employee unions, regulated industries, service recipients—lobby intensively during review periods. Commissioners face political pressure to preserve popular programs regardless of evidence. Some eliminated agencies were later recreated under different names when political pressure mounted.

**Gaming the review**: Agencies prepare extensively for sunset reviews, presenting best-case scenarios and highlighting successes while downplaying failures. Long-term employees know the review cycle and can time program launches to coincide with reviews. The commission has limited investigative resources relative to agencies' abilities to manage appearances.

**Self-perpetuation debates**: The Texas legislature has repeatedly debated abolishing the Sunset Commission itself, arguing it creates permanent review bureaucracy with its own survival incentives. The commission continues because it generates documented savings, but this illustrates how oversight bodies themselves require oversight.

### What Texas demonstrates

The 45-year Texas experience proves that **systematic automatic review is logistically feasible at large scale**—80% of state government can be reviewed on 12-year cycles. The process generates measurable value (roughly $20 returned per dollar spent). High implementation rates indicate legislative trust in commission findings.

But Texas also proves that automatic termination creates severe problems when applied rigidly to essential services, that gaming by sophisticated bureaucracies is inevitable, and that political pressure from stakeholders influences outcomes regardless of evidence. The system works best for identifying obsolete or poorly performing programs; it struggles with major essential services where abolition is politically impossible regardless of performance.

## UK evidence institutions: Advisory authority becoming mandatory

The UK's approach differs from Texas—rather than automatic abolition, the UK created independent advisory bodies whose recommendations carry such weight that they become effectively mandatory despite lacking formal enforcement power.

### NICE: Advisory guidelines that became legal obligations

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), established in 1999, was originally purely advisory—producing clinical guidelines that healthcare providers could choose to follow or ignore. Over time, its authority strengthened to near-mandatory status.

**Current legal framework** (since 2005): The NHS is **legally obligated to fund medicines and treatments recommended through NICE Technology Appraisals within three months**. This isn't technically binding in the sense of criminal penalties for non-compliance, but court decisions have progressively strengthened it:

- *R (Elizabeth Rose) v. Thanet CCG* (2014): Healthcare bodies cannot simply disagree with NICE guidance; they must follow it unless exceptional circumstances justify deviation.
- *Montgomery v. Lanarkshire* (2015): Failure to follow NICE guidelines may constitute medical negligence—creating liability exposure that makes deviation legally risky.

**How NICE maintains credibility**:
- Transparent methodology: All evaluation criteria, weighting systems, and cost-effectiveness thresholds are publicly documented
- Independent expert committees: Clinicians, patients, health economists, and ethicists serve on appraisal committees
- Public consultation: Draft guidance undergoes comment periods where anyone can challenge methodology or evidence
- Appeals process: Pharmaceutical companies, patient groups, or healthcare providers can appeal decisions through structured procedures
- Published evidence base: Complete evidence reviews published with recommendations, allowing external verification

NICE's authority derives from **credibility rather than coercion**. Healthcare providers follow NICE guidelines because courts accept them as standard of care, insurers structure coverage around them, and professional reputations depend on evidence-based practice. Advisory power became binding through accumulated trust.

**The limitations**: NICE faces constant criticism for "rationing" healthcare by denying cost-ineffective treatments. The implicit cost-effectiveness threshold (approximately £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life year) means potentially beneficial treatments are rejected if too expensive. This is technically correct evidence-based evaluation, but politically controversial when specific patients are denied treatments that might help them.

### What Works Network: Embedding evidence in policy

Established in 2013, the UK What Works Network coordinates seven independent centers covering policy areas accounting for **over £250 billion in public spending**:
- What Works Centre for Crime Reduction
- Early Intervention Foundation
- Education Endowment Foundation
- What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth
- What Works Centre for Wellbeing
- What Works Centre for Children's Social Care
- NHS England's National Institute for Health Research

**Education Endowment Foundation** exemplifies the model's potential. It has commissioned **over 10% of all known education randomized controlled trials worldwide**, testing 190+ programs with 1.3 million children. Its Teaching and Learning Toolkit summarizes evidence on educational interventions, rating them by effect size and implementation cost. The toolkit is now used by **70% of UK secondary schools**, with 45% of school leaders using it for spending decisions.

**Key structural features**:
- Arm's-length independence: Funded through endowments or multi-year government grants, not annual appropriations subject to political manipulation
- Transparent methodology: Published standards for evidence quality (randomized trials > quasi-experimental > correlational > expert opinion)
- Systematic reviews: Comprehensive syntheses of existing research, not cherry-picked studies supporting predetermined conclusions
- Practical guidance: Recommendations specify what works, for whom, under what conditions, at what cost
- Practitioner involvement: Teachers, police officers, social workers participate in evidence generation and translation

**The limitations**: What Works centers can identify effective interventions but cannot force implementation. Local authorities and schools remain free to ignore evidence-based recommendations. Some centers struggle with limited evidence bases—many social interventions lack rigorous evaluation, leaving What Works centers synthesizing weak studies. Political priorities often override evidence when they conflict with ideology or electoral concerns.

### Office for Budget Responsibility: Market-enforced credibility

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), created in 2010, demonstrates how advisory bodies gain binding authority through **market consequences** rather than legal mandates. The OBR produces independent economic forecasts and evaluates fiscal plans—technically advisory with no power to block government budgets.

When the Truss government sidelined the OBR before announcing major unfunded tax cuts in September 2022, **bond yields spiked immediately**. The 30-year gilt yield jumped from 3.83% to 5.14% in three weeks—a massive increase making government borrowing prohibitively expensive. The pound fell to $1.035 (near parity with the dollar for the first time). The Bank of England intervened with £65 billion to prevent pension fund collapses. Within 49 days, Truss resigned—the shortest premiership in British history.

The OBR has no enforcement mechanism. It cannot block budgets or impose fiscal rules. But **markets incorporate OBR assessments into pricing**, making government credibility contingent on OBR endorsement. Bypassing the OBR signals that fiscal plans won't survive independent scrutiny—causing markets to price in higher risk, forcing policy reversal through financial pressure.

**The insight**: Independent evaluation bodies gain authority through transparent methodology, consistent application of standards, and external verification by markets, courts, or professional communities. Legal mandates help but aren't necessary if reputation creates binding consequences.

## Goodhart's Law: The most severe implementation challenge

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"—this principle, formalized by economist Charles Goodhart, describes the most documented failure mode of evidence-based policy. **Any metric used for evaluation will be gamed, manipulated, or optimized in ways that undermine its original purpose.**

### UK hospital waiting times: The canonical example

In 2000, the UK government set a target: **98% of emergency department patients must be seen within four hours**. The metric was reasonable—long waiting times indicate inadequate capacity or inefficiency, and reducing them improves patient outcomes. Initial results looked promising: hospitals that had regularly exceeded four hours brought average times down.

But within years, systematic gaming emerged:

**Clock manipulation**:
- Ambulances queued patients outside hospitals in parking lots so admission clocks wouldn't start
- Patients received "corridor care" in hallways rather than proper rooms to avoid starting formal admission
- Hospitals created "clinical decision units" that weren't officially emergency departments, parking patients there until treatment capacity opened
- Discharges spiked dramatically in the final 20 minutes before four-hour deadlines—not because patients were ready but because hitting the metric became more important than medical judgment

**Data manipulation**:
- Hospitals re-categorized emergency visits as non-urgent to remove them from four-hour statistics
- Some trusts simply stopped recording breaches correctly
- Pressure on emergency department staff to meet targets led to incomplete documentation

**Consequences**:
- Since September 2012, hospitals have **consistently missed the target**—only 4 of 139 major emergency departments met it in October-December 2016
- Staff report intense pressure compromising clinical judgment
- The Care Quality Commission found target pressure contributed to staffing problems and poor care quality
- The metric that was supposed to improve care became a source of distorted priorities

The UK eventually abandoned the four-hour target in favor of more nuanced clinical priority measures—acknowledging that a single metric cannot capture complex emergency care quality.

### UK police crime statistics: Organizational manipulation

A 2013-2014 inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found approximately **800,000 crimes per year (19%) were not recorded properly**. The manipulation was systematic:

**Under-recording crimes**:
- 33% of violent crimes incorrectly "no-crimed" (determined not to be crimes after initial report)
- 37% of reported rapes not recorded as crimes
- Serious sexual assaults downgraded to minor offenses
- Domestic violence incidents systematically under-recorded

**Why it happened**: Police forces faced performance targets based on crime reduction. Senior officers received promotions and recognition based on declining crime statistics. Individual officers received unofficial monthly arrest quotas despite official denials. The easiest way to show "declining crime" was to not record crimes in the first place.

A former chief inspector turned whistleblower described the manipulation as "organisational in nature"—not individual officers committing fraud but entire police forces structuring operations to hit metrics regardless of accuracy. The UK Statistics Authority withdrew "National Statistics" accreditation from police crime data entirely, the most severe condemnation possible for official statistics.

### New Zealand Social Investment: Targeting concerns

New Zealand's Social Investment Approach (2015-2017) calculated "forward liability"—the projected government cost of at-risk individuals from current age to 35. The system identified children and families likely to require expensive interventions (justice, corrections, mental health services) and prioritized early intervention for high-liability cases.

**The logic seemed sound**: Identify at-risk individuals early, intervene proactively, reduce long-term costs. Evidence-based prediction models would target scarce resources effectively.

**Criticism mounted quickly**:
- **Treating citizens as costs**: Framing people as "million dollar kids" based on projected government expenditure reduces human beings to financial liabilities
- **Stigmatizing labels**: Being flagged as high-cost creates permanent records that could affect education, employment, housing
- **Ignoring structural causes**: Focusing on individual intervention rather than addressing poverty, housing instability, or systemic inequality that creates risk
- **Privacy concerns**: The Privacy Commissioner criticized individual-level tracking and data sharing across agencies

The approach survived a change of government but was substantially reframed away from individual liability calculations toward community-level investment in services. The experience demonstrates that **technically sophisticated evidence-based targeting can create social problems exceeding its benefits**.

### Why gaming is inevitable

Goodhart's Law operates because **people respond rationally to incentives**:

1. **Metrics create pressure**: When evaluation depends on specific measures, everyone optimizes for those measures
2. **Metrics are incomplete**: No single metric captures the full complexity of policy goals—hospitals want short waiting times AND good clinical outcomes; police want low crime AND accurate reporting
3. **Gaming is easier than improvement**: Manipulating data or processes to hit metrics requires less effort than genuinely improving outcomes
4. **Institutional survival**: Agencies facing termination will game metrics rather than accept abolition
5. **Diffused consequences**: Gaming often produces small diffuse harms (individual patients waiting in ambulances, individual unreported crimes) while generating concentrated visible benefits (hospital hitting targets, police force celebrated for crime reduction)

### Mitigation strategies

Completely preventing gaming is impossible, but systems can make it harder and less damaging:

**Multiple complementary metrics**: Use 3-5 different measures that are difficult to game simultaneously. UK hospitals now use: waiting time, patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, mortality rates, infection rates. Gaming all five simultaneously is much harder than gaming one.

**Independent verification**: Separate data collection from performance management. Texas Sunset Commission staff investigate independently rather than relying on agency self-reporting. Healthcare regulators conduct surprise inspections rather than announced reviews.

**Transparent methodology**: Publish exactly how metrics are calculated and what counts. This allows external scrutiny and makes hidden manipulation easier to detect.

**"Sterile corridors"**: Separate the people gathering data from those being evaluated. UK healthcare quality inspectors work for separate agencies than hospitals; they have no incentive to inflate performance numbers.

**Process and outcome measures**: Combine measures of what agencies do (process) with measures of results (outcomes). Emergency departments measured on both time-to-treatment (process) and patient health outcomes (results) cannot easily game both.

**Qualitative assessment**: Include subjective judgment alongside quantitative metrics. NICE doesn't rely solely on cost-effectiveness ratios—panels exercise judgment about fairness, patient experience, and social value. This is harder to game than pure formulas.

**Accept imperfection**: Recognize that all metrics are flawed proxies and that judgment must supplement data. Roman censors relied on judgment precisely because they understood no formula could capture virtue or effectiveness. Modern systems need both metrics (for accountability) and judgment (for wisdom).

## Institutional capture: The constant risk

Even well-designed independent bodies face **regulatory capture**—when the institutions meant to provide oversight become controlled by those they're supposed to oversee.

### How capture happens

**Revolving door employment**: Regulatory staff expect future employment by regulated industries. FAA inspectors who approve Boeing aircraft seek jobs at Boeing. This creates conflicts where tough enforcement threatens personal career prospects.

**Expertise dependence**: Complex technical domains require specialized knowledge that only industry insiders possess. Nuclear regulators must understand reactor physics; financial regulators must understand derivatives pricing. The talent pool is limited—regulators often come from industry and return to it.

**Information asymmetry**: Regulated entities know their operations intimately; regulators depend on disclosed information. Agencies can present sanitized data during reviews, hiding problems while highlighting successes.

**Political pressure**: Industries employ lobbyists, make campaign contributions, and mobilize workers/customers to pressure politicians. Politicians pressure regulators through budget control, appointment authority, and public criticism.

**Cultural alignment**: Long-term interactions create shared worldviews. Regulators come to see industry challenges sympathetically, adopting industry's perspective on what's "reasonable" or "practical."

### Documented failures

**Boeing 737 Max / FAA**: The FAA delegated safety certification of the 737 Max to Boeing itself under the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program. Boeing engineers approved their own company's design. Two crashes killed 346 people. Post-crash investigations revealed the FAA lacked expertise and resources to conduct independent oversight, making it dependent on Boeing's assessments. Regulatory capture contributed directly to catastrophic failure.

**Fukushima / Japanese Nuclear Regulators**: The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency approved 10-year reactor operation extensions for Fukushima Daiichi Units 1 & 2 in February 2011—one month before the disaster. The agency operated under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which promoted nuclear power expansion. This structural arrangement created capture—regulators served under a ministry whose mission was nuclear promotion, not nuclear safety. After Fukushima, Japan created an independent Nuclear Regulation Authority separate from promotional agencies.

**Financial crisis / SEC and Fed**: Multiple investigations concluded that financial regulators became too aligned with industry perspectives during the 1990s-2000s, viewing their role as facilitating markets rather than constraining risk. The "Greenspan doctrine" held that sophisticated market participants would self-regulate through rational risk management. Regulatory capture enabled the overleveraging and fraud that produced the 2008 crisis.

### Protections against capture

Successful independent institutions share design features that resist capture:

**Statutory basis**: Legal foundations requiring legislative majorities to alter create stability. The Federal Reserve's independence is codified in law; changing it requires Congressional action. This makes capture harder than if the Fed operated through executive order.

**Long non-renewable terms**: Federal Reserve governors serve 14-year terms and cannot be reappointed. This removes the incentive to curry favor for reappointment. Terms are staggered so no single president appoints a majority. This insulates decisions from political cycles.

**Multiple appointment authorities**: Bipartisan appointment processes prevent single-party capture. The Congressional Budget Office director is jointly appointed by Senate and House leadership. Australian Electoral Commission members require parliamentary confirmation.

**Independent funding**: Bodies funded through dedicated revenue streams or multi-year appropriations face less political pressure than those dependent on annual budgets. NICE is funded through the NHS budget but with protected multi-year allocations.

**Transparency requirements**: Mandatory public reporting, published methodology, and open meetings make capture harder to hide. The Federal Reserve publishes meeting transcripts (with delay), explains monetary policy decisions publicly, and faces regular Congressional testimony.

**Mandatory rotation**: Limiting how long officials can serve prevents entrenchment. Texas Sunset Commission members serve staggered terms with mandatory rotation, preventing permanent power bases.

**Whistleblower protections**: Strong legal protections for internal dissent allow staff to expose capture attempts without career destruction. The UK's Public Interest Disclosure Act protects whistleblowers who report regulatory failures.

**External review**: Subject oversight bodies themselves to periodic evaluation. Australian Electoral Commission faces review by parliamentary committees. The Texas legislature periodically debates abolishing the Sunset Commission—accountability for the accountability body.

### The Roman model's applicability

Roman censors resisted capture through different mechanisms than modern institutions:

**Prestige and reputation**: Censors had completed distinguished careers; their legacy depended on maintaining honor. A censor who visibly served special interests lost the *auctoritas* that made censorial judgment authoritative.

**Limited term**: 18 months prevented entrenchment and building of political machines beholden to specific interests.

**No ongoing professional relationship**: Censors weren't career regulators who would seek post-service employment from those they regulated. They served briefly at the end of careers, making them less susceptible to industry influence.

**Public accountability**: Subscriptio censoria (written justifications) created records that could damage reputation if decisions appeared corrupt or arbitrary.

**Cultural expectations**: Romans understood the censorship as sacred duty; violating this carried social stigma exceeding any financial benefit from capture.

The Stellar Republic must translate these protections into modern institutional design: Censors serve limited terms after distinguished careers, face transparent reporting requirements, operate independently of agencies they evaluate, and derive authority from reputation more than formal power.

## Implementation recommendations for the Stellar Republic

### Select Censors who have completed distinguished careers

Roman censors derived moral authority from decades of proven service. The Stellar Republic's Censors must follow this model—**not career bureaucrats or technical specialists but citizens who have demonstrated virtue across multiple domains**.

**Eligibility requirements**:
- Minimum 15-20 years distinguished public service across multiple roles
- Successful completion of at least senior military command OR equivalent civilian leadership (planetary governor, major infrastructure director, research institution leader)
- No criminal record, ethics violations, or censorial notes
- Federal citizenship (having completed full 6+ year service requirement)

**Selection process**:
- Federal citizens nominate candidates through petition (requiring 100,000 citizen signatures)
- Senate screens nominees for qualifications and conducts public hearings
- Assembly of Citizens votes on approved nominees (requiring 60% supermajority)
- Three Censors selected from top vote recipients, serving as collegial body

**Term limits**:
- Single 5-year term, non-renewable
- Staggered terms so one Censor rotates out every 20 months
- Mandatory 10-year interval before eligible for re-selection

This creates Censors who possess moral authority from demonstrated character, technical competence from diverse experience, and political legitimacy from direct citizen election.

### Require collegial decision-making

Following Roman practice, **major censorial decisions require unanimous agreement** from all three Censors. Any single Censor can block policy termination or modification, forcing consensus or inaction. This prevents individual excess and ensures decisions have support from multiple perspectives.

For routine matters (scheduling reviews, requesting information, publishing reports), majority vote suffices. But for consequential decisions (recommending policy termination, issuing censorial notes, declaring policies successful/failed), unanimity is required.

**Dissenting opinions**: When Censors disagree, they publish dissenting opinions explaining their reasoning. This creates public accountability and enables Senate to understand the full range of expert views.

### Use multiple complementary metrics, not single targets

Policies should be evaluated through **3-7 different metrics** that capture different aspects of success:

**Example - Education policy aimed at improving literacy**:
- Primary metric: Reading comprehension scores on standardized tests
- Secondary metrics: Graduation rates, teacher retention, parent satisfaction, cost per student, equity across demographics
- Qualitative assessment: Classroom observations, student interviews, long-term life outcomes

No single metric should determine policy continuation. Gaming all seven simultaneously is far harder than gaming one. If test scores rise but teacher retention collapses and costs explode, the policy is not succeeding—it's teaching to tests while destroying educational infrastructure.

**Process and outcome balance**: Combine measures of implementation (is the policy being executed as designed?) with measures of results (is it achieving intended outcomes?). This catches both well-designed policies with poor implementation and well-implemented policies with flawed design.

### Separate data collection from evaluation

**"Sterile corridors"** separate organizations gathering implementation data from those assessing success:

**Implementation agencies**: Execute policies, collect routine data on activities and outputs
**Independent statistical offices**: Verify data accuracy, conduct random audits, investigate discrepancies
**Censors**: Evaluate policy success using verified data, conduct independent investigations

If the agency responsible for a poverty-reduction program also produces the statistics showing poverty reduction, manipulation is inevitable. Independent statistical verification—analogous to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or UK Office for National Statistics—prevents this.

Censors should have **investigative authority** similar to Texas Sunset Commission: power to attend closed meetings, review privileged documents, subpoena information, conduct surprise site visits. But they shouldn't rely primarily on agency self-reporting.

### Build transparency into methodology and findings

Every censorial evaluation should include:

**Published methodology**: How metrics were selected, how data was gathered, what standards were applied, what alternatives were considered
**Complete evidence base**: All data used in evaluation, including contradictory evidence
**Reasoning**: Detailed explanation connecting evidence to conclusions
**Minority opinions**: Dissenting Censor views when unanimity wasn't reached
**Public comment period**: 60-day window for stakeholders, citizens, and experts to challenge methodology or evidence before final recommendations

This creates reputational accountability even without enforcement power. If Censors make decisions that seem arbitrary, biased, or unsupported by evidence, their moral authority erodes. Transparency enables external verification that sustains credibility.

### Allow policy adjustment, not just termination

**Binary continue/abolish decisions encourage gaming**—agencies will manipulate data to barely meet thresholds rather than genuinely improve. The Stellar Republic should allow **four outcomes**:

1. **Continue unchanged**: Policy meets or exceeds objectives, requires no modification
2. **Continue with adjustments**: Policy shows promise but needs refinement; Censors recommend specific modifications
3. **Restructure**: Policy addresses legitimate need but current approach is flawed; major redesign required
4. **Terminate**: Policy failed to achieve objectives, better alternatives exist, or original need no longer exists

This creates incentives for continuous improvement rather than bare minimum compliance. Agencies that proactively propose improvements based on evidence are viewed favorably; those that defend failed approaches face termination.

### Build in Senate oversight with meaningful debate

Censors' recommendations go to the Senate for **mandatory debate and vote within 90 days**. The Senate can:
- Accept recommendations and implement through legislation
- Request additional investigation on specific points
- Reject recommendations with two-thirds supermajority (requiring Censors to provide additional justification or accept Senate judgment)

This balances Censor authority (they initiate evaluation and make recommendations) with Senate ultimate sovereignty (they decide whether to implement). Roman practice echoed this: censors exercised *regimen morum* but Senate held ultimate legislative power and could override through subsequent legislation.

**Public debate requirement**: Senate debates on censorial recommendations must be public, recorded, and published. Senators must articulate reasoning for accepting or rejecting recommendations, creating accountability for both Censors and legislators.

### Policy design requirements from inception

All major policies at passage must include:

**Timeframe**: Specific review date (2-10 years depending on policy complexity and expected impact timeline)
**Quantifiable objectives**: Numerical targets or measurable outcomes defining success (not vague "improve quality of life" but "reduce poverty rate from 15% to 10%")
**Metric selection**: 3-7 complementary metrics capturing different success dimensions
**Data collection plan**: How required data will be gathered, by whom, with what verification
**Alternative scenarios**: Contingency plans if circumstances change (economic crisis, technological breakthrough, demographic shifts)

Policies lacking these elements should be rejected during legislative consideration. This forces deliberate thought about what success means and how it will be measured, preventing vague aspirational legislation with no accountability.

### Recognize that judgment must supplement metrics

Despite extensive metrics, **human judgment remains essential**. Censors must exercise wisdom in interpreting data:

**Context matters**: A poverty-reduction program might fail to meet targets during economic recession through no fault of design. Censors should consider whether failure reflects poor policy or external circumstances.

**Unintended consequences**: Metrics capture intended outcomes but may miss side effects. A successful job-training program that reduces unemployment but also increases family stress or displaces existing workers might need modification despite hitting targets.

**Long-term versus short-term**: Some policies require patience—infrastructure investments, educational reforms, scientific research show benefits over decades. Short-term metrics may miss long-term success.

**Qualitative factors**: Some important outcomes resist quantification—social cohesion, civic virtue, cultural vitality. Censors should incorporate qualitative assessment alongside metrics.

**Goodhart's Law**: When metrics show dramatic success, investigate whether genuine improvement occurred or gaming happened. Roman censors trusted their judgment precisely because they understood no formula could capture truth completely.

This requires selecting Censors who possess **wisdom and practical experience**, not just technical expertise. A distinguished career across multiple domains develops the judgment needed to interpret complex evidence wisely.

## Connection to tiered citizenship benefits

The time-limited policy evaluation system connects to the Stellar Republic's tiered citizenship benefits in several reinforcing ways:

**GBI itself is subject to evaluation**: The citizenship benefit system should be reviewed every 5-7 years by Censors using specific metrics: poverty rates, health outcomes, citizenship advancement rates, work participation, administrative costs. If the system fails to meet objectives, Censors recommend modifications.

**Mutual accountability**: Citizens receiving scaled benefits have incentives to demand effective governance—those investing more years in service want assurance their contributions matter. This creates natural political support for rigorous policy evaluation. Conversely, effective policy evaluation prevents waste of resources that fund benefits.

**Citizenship advancement as success metric**: For many policies (education, economic development, infrastructure), "percentage of residents advancing through citizenship tiers" serves as a valid outcome measure. Policies enabling more people to complete service and advance demonstrate they're creating opportunity.

**Shared philosophical foundations**: Both systems emphasize earned merit over entitlement, reciprocal obligations, evidence over ideology, and long-term thinking over short-term political expediency. They reinforce the same Republican values through different mechanisms.

**Prevention of power concentration**: Tiered benefits distribute material resources while maintaining contribution incentives. Time-limited policies prevent institutional entrenchment. Together they address the concentration of power that destroyed the Roman Republic—benefits prevent aristocratic hoarding, evaluation prevents program permanence regardless of effectiveness.

See the separate document "Tiered Citizenship Benefits in the Stellar Republic" for detailed examination of how the GBI system aligns with Roman values and modern economic evidence.

## Critical tensions and open questions

### Political will to enforce termination

Texas's 2009 failure to renew the Department of Transportation demonstrates that **automatic termination is politically difficult for essential services**. Even with clear sunset requirements, legislatures hesitate to actually abolish major programs with organized stakeholders.

The Stellar Republic must address this through careful policy categorization. Essential services with no viable alternatives (emergency response, basic healthcare, infrastructure maintenance) should have longer review cycles (10+ years) with emphasis on improvement rather than termination. Experimental programs, specific interventions, and newer initiatives should face shorter cycles (2-5 years) where termination is realistic.

But if Censors consistently recommend termination and the Senate consistently rejects recommendations, the system loses credibility. This requires **cultural acceptance that some policies will end**—not all programs succeed, and continuing failed policies wastes resources that could fund better alternatives.

### Risk of innovation paralysis

If every policy faces automatic review with possibility of termination, risk-averse politicians might avoid bold new initiatives. Why propose ambitious reforms when cautious incrementalism is safer?

The counter-argument: time-limited evaluation actually **enables innovation** by reducing political costs of failure. When policies automatically terminate if unsuccessful, there's less stigma in trying ambitious approaches. Failures are expected and designed for; they don't represent permanent mistakes but learning opportunities.

This requires framing evaluation as **continuous improvement rather than punishment**. Censors should celebrate well-designed experiments that fail (because they advance knowledge about what doesn't work) while criticizing poorly designed programs that limp along without accountability.

### Censor political independence

How independent can Censors truly be when selected through political processes (Senate screening, citizen election)? Won't political factions try to capture the censorship by electing aligned candidates?

Multiple protections mitigate this:
- **Long terms (5 years) exceed political cycles**, reducing incentive to please specific politicians
- **Non-renewable terms** remove reelection pressures
- **Supermajority requirements** for selection (60% of citizens) force broad consensus rather than narrow partisan majorities
- **Collegial decision-making** (unanimous agreement required) prevents single-party control
- **Transparent methodology and public debate** create reputational accountability exceeding partisan loyalty

But ultimately, independence requires **cultural acceptance** of Censors' authority. Roman censors maintained independence partly through prestige and tradition—the office stood above factional politics by cultural understanding. The Stellar Republic must cultivate similar norms where censorial impartiality is expected and valued.

## Conclusion: Balancing judgment and evidence

The Stellar Republic's proposed time-limited policy evaluation by Censors can authentically reflect Roman institutional design while incorporating modern evidence-based practice—but only by **integrating moral authority with technical competence**.

Roman censors derived authority from demonstrated virtue over distinguished careers—citizens trusted their judgment because they had proven their character through decades of service. Modern evidence-based evaluation derives authority from transparent methodology, systematic data analysis, and external verification. The Stellar Republic needs both:

**Censors must possess moral authority** earned through distinguished service across multiple domains, selected by citizens for proven character, serving limited terms at the end of careers. This creates the *auctoritas* that makes their judgments culturally binding even without enforcement power.

**But Censors must also employ rigorous evidence-based methods**: multiple complementary metrics, independent data verification, transparent methodology, public accountability, and awareness of gaming risks. Pure moral judgment without systematic evidence becomes arbitrary; pure technocratic analysis without wisdom becomes vulnerable to Goodhart's Law.

The Roman censorship succeeded for 400+ years because it balanced **institutional power with institutional limits**: censors could judge conduct and impose consequences, but they operated within frameworks requiring consensus, justification, limited terms, and acceptance of reversal. When censors exceeded their authority or became tools of political faction, the institution lost legitimacy.

The Stellar Republic can learn from both Roman successes and modern evidence on systematic review, creating Censors who combine the moral weight of Roman magistrates with the methodological rigor of modern evaluation bodies. This produces policies that are evidence-based, continuously improving, and accountable to both expert judgment and democratic oversight—authentically Roman in philosophy while incorporating lessons from 2,000 years of institutional evolution.
