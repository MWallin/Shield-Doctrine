# Research Folder - README

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

## What This Folder Is For

The `research/` folder contains **exploratory research and reference material** that informs worldbuilding and story development. This is NOT canonical worldbuilding—it's the research that helps you make decisions about what becomes canon.

**Think of it as:** Your personal library of background research.

## How to Use This Folder

### **When Doing Research:**
1. Create a markdown file for the topic
2. Name it descriptively (`Roman Military Ranks.md`, not `Research 1.md`)
3. Add notes, links, ideas, questions
4. Mark status: Exploring, Decided, Needs Decision

### **When Research Is Complete:**
1. Extract final decisions into canonical worldbuilding docs
2. Mark research file status as "Integrated"
3. Note which worldbuilding docs now contain this information
4. Keep research file for reference (don't delete!)

### **When Starting New Work:**
1. Check research folder—is there existing research on this topic?
2. Review before making worldbuilding decisions
3. Avoid contradicting decisions already researched

---

## Research Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Exploration**
- Researching options
- Gathering information
- Brainstorming possibilities
- Status: "Exploratory"

**Phase 2: Decision**
- Choose which option to use
- Make specific determinations
- Status: "Decided"

**Phase 3: Integration**
- Extract decisions into worldbuilding docs
- Document in canonical sources
- Status: "Integrated into [filename]"

**Phase 4: Reference**
- Keep research file for future reference
- Shows your reasoning
- Useful if you need to revisit decisions

---

## Status Markers

Add status to each file's header:

```markdown
# [Topic]

**Status:** Exploratory / Decided / Integrated
**Integrated Into:** [worldbuilding doc filename if applicable]
**Date:** [When researched]
**Purpose:** [What question does this answer?]

---

[Research content]
```

## What Should (and Shouldn't) Be Here

### **✅ GOOD for research/:**
- Background research on topics
- Comparison of options (should we use X or Y?)
- Real-world references (Roman military structure, modern tactics)
- Technical feasibility research
- Historical parallels
- "How does this work?" explorations

### **❌ NOT for research/:**
- Canonical worldbuilding (goes in `world-building/`)
- Story drafts (goes in `chapters/`)
- Character profiles (goes in `characters/`)
- Active planning (goes in `planning NEW/`)
- Style guides (goes in `correctness/`)

## Integration Checklist

When integrating research into worldbuilding:

- [ ] Extract key decisions from research
- [ ] Add to appropriate worldbuilding document(s)
- [ ] Update research file status to "Integrated"
- [ ] Note which worldbuilding docs now contain this info
- [ ] Keep research file (don't delete—useful reference)
- [ ] Check for contradictions with existing worldbuilding

---

## Example: Research → Worldbuilding Flow

**Step 1: Research**
- Create `research/Phase Shield Physics.md`
- Research how phase-variance could work
- Explore options, limitations, possibilities
- Status: "Exploratory"

**Step 2: Decision**
- Choose which physics model to use
- Determine specific limitations
- Status: "Decided"

**Step 3: Integration**
- Extract final specs into `world-building/Key Technology.md`
- Update research file:
  - Status: "Integrated into Key Technology.md"
  - Add note: "Final decisions in Key Technology.md, lines 1-217"

**Step 4: Reference**
- Keep `Phase Shield Physics.md` in research/
- Useful if you need to remember why you chose this approach
- Shows research that informed final decision

## Maintenance

**Periodically review this folder:**
1. Are there exploratory files ready to be decided?
2. Are there decided files ready to be integrated?
3. Are there old files that can be archived?
4. Update status markers
5. Ensure integrated files note where they were integrated
