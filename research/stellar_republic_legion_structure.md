# Stellar Republic Legion Structure
## A Streamlined Roman-Inspired Military Hierarchy

## Legion Overview

**Total Strength: ~6,100 soldiers**
- First Cohort: 1,200 soldiers (elite, double-strength)
- Cohorts II-X: 600 soldiers each (standard)

---

## The Century: Basic Building Block

### Standard Century (Cohorts II-X)
**100 soldiers + 2 officers = 102 total**

**Command:**
- 1 Centurion (commander, outside the 100 count)
- 1 Optio (second-in-command, outside the 100 count)

**Organization:**
- 10 squads of 10 soldiers each
- Each squad led by a Decanus (included in the 100 count)

**Specialists:** (also included in the 100 count)
- 1 Signifer (standard bearer, carries century's standard)
- 1 Cornicen (horn blower, signals orders)
- 1 Tesserarius (watch officer, manages guard rotations and passwords)

**Math check:**
- 97 regular legionaries
- 10 Decani (squad leaders)
- 3 specialists (signifer, cornicen, tesserarius)
- = 110 total in century (100 counted legionaries + centurion + optio)

---

## First Cohort Century (Elite, Double-Strength)
**200 soldiers + 2 officers = 202 total**

**Command:**
- 1 Centurion (commander)
- 1 Optio (second-in-command)

**Organization:**
- 20 squads of 10 soldiers each
- Each squad led by a Decanus (included in the 200 count)

**Specialists:** (included in the 200 count)
- 2 Signiferi (two standard bearers for larger unit)
- 2 Cornicenes (two horn blowers)
- 2 Tesserarii (two watch officers)

**Math check:**
- 174 regular legionaries
- 20 Decani (squad leaders)
- 6 specialists
- = 200 + centurion + optio = 202 total

---

## The Cohort: Six Centuries Working Together

### Second Cohort (Standard Example)
**600 soldiers, 6 centuries**

**Six Centurions, ranked by seniority:**

1. **Pilus Prior** ("First Spear") - Cohort commander, most senior
2. **Princeps Prior** ("First Leader")
3. **Hastatus Prior** ("First Spearman")
4. **Pilus Posterior** ("Second Spear")
5. **Princeps Posterior** ("Second Leader")
6. **Hastatus Posterior** ("Second Spearman") - Most junior

**Note:** These titles are historical holdovers. In practice, you can reference them simply as "the cohort's senior centurion" or "the Pilus Prior of Second Cohort" without explaining all six ranks every time.

**Command Structure:**
- The Pilus Prior commands the entire cohort in battle
- Each centurion commands their own century
- The six centurions coordinate tactics through the Pilus Prior

---

## First Cohort (Elite, Double-Strength)
**1,200 soldiers, 6 centuries of 200 each**

**Five Elite Centurions** (called the *Primi Ordines* - "Ranks of the First"):

1. **Primus Pilus** - "First Spear," the most senior centurion in the entire legion
2. **Princeps Prior** - Second-most senior
3. **Hastatus Prior**
4. **Princeps Posterior**
5. **Hastatus Posterior** - Still elite, but most junior of First Cohort

**Why only five centurions?**
Each First Cohort centurion commands 200 soldiers instead of 100. The First Cohort serves as the legion's elite core, guards the legion's eagle standard, and provides reserves for critical moments.

**Special Status:**
- The Primus Pilus participates in legion command councils
- The Primus Pilus earns roughly 6x what a standard centurion earns
- First Cohort centurions earn roughly 3x standard centurion pay
- Service in First Cohort is the pinnacle of an NCO career

---

## Legion Command Structure

### The Legion (~6,100 soldiers)

**Senior Command:**

**Legatus** (Legion Commander)
- Overall commander of the entire legion
- Typically 15-25 years military experience
- Coordinates all cohort operations
- Reports to Fleet Admiral or Sector Command

**Tribune** (Senior Staff Officer)
- Second-in-command to the Legatus
- Typically 10-15 years experience
- Handles logistics, planning, administration
- Steps in when Legatus commands multiple legions

**Primus Pilus** (Senior Centurion)
- Most senior NCO, commands First Cohort
- Voice of the centurions to senior command
- Participates in tactical planning
- 18-25 years service minimum

**Praefectus Castrorum** (Camp Prefect / Chief of Staff)
- Typically a former Primus Pilus
- Manages all logistics, supply, fortifications
- Third in formal command hierarchy
- Handles day-to-day administration

---

### Staff Specialists (Legion Level)

**Praefectus Fabrum** (Chief Engineer)
- Commands all engineering operations
- Fortifications, breaching, demolitions
- Reports to Praefectus Castrorum

**Praefectus Annonae** (Chief of Supply)
- All logistics and supply operations
- Ammunition, equipment, food, medical supplies
- Reports to Praefectus Castrorum

**Medical Staff**
- Chief Medical Officer (senior physician)
- Field surgeons assigned to cohorts
- Medical support staff

---

## How It All Fits Together

### Chain of Command (Example: Second Cohort, Third Century):

**Legionary** 
→ **Decanus** (squad leader)
→ **Tesserarius/Signifer/Cornicen** (specialists, peer to Decanus)
→ **Optio** (second-in-command of century)
→ **Centurion** (century commander)
→ **Pilus Prior** (cohort commander - the senior centurion of Second Cohort)
→ **Legatus** (legion commander)

### Parallel Command Paths:

**Primus Pilus** sits between the regular centurions and the Legatus:
- Regular Centurions report to their Pilus Prior
- All Pilus Priors coordinate through the Primus Pilus
- The Primus Pilus advises the Legatus and Tribune

---

## Simple Reference: Who Commands What

| Rank | Commands | Typical Soldiers |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Decanus** | Squad | 9 soldiers (10 total including self) |
| **Optio** | Assists centurion | Whole century |
| **Centurion** | Century | 100 soldiers (200 in First Cohort) |
| **Pilus Prior** | Cohort | 600 soldiers (1,200 in First Cohort) |
| **Primus Pilus** | First Cohort | 1,200 elite soldiers |
| **Tribune** | Staff/Admin | Entire legion support |
| **Legatus** | Legion | ~6,100 soldiers |

---

## Career Progression

**Typical NCO Path:**

1. **Legionary** (enlisted, 0-4 years)
2. **Specialist** positions (signifer, cornicen, tesserarius) (4-8 years)
3. **Decanus** (squad leader) (8-12 years)
4. **Optio** (second-in-command of century) (12-16 years)
5. **Centurion** (century commander) (16-20 years)
6. **Pilus Prior** (cohort commander) (20-25 years)
7. **First Cohort Centurion** (elite centurion) (25+ years)
8. **Primus Pilus** (senior centurion) (30+ years, one year appointment)
9. **Praefectus Castrorum** (camp prefect, staff position) (post-Primus Pilus)

**Notes:**
- Not everyone advances through all ranks
- Most soldiers serve 6-12 years and separate
- Reaching centurion rank is exceptional
- Reaching First Cohort is the pinnacle of an NCO career

## Separation of Fleet and Legion Command

**Fleet Structure (Naval Officers):**
- Admiral → Commodore → Captain → Commander → Lieutenant

**Legion Structure (Ground Forces):**
- Legatus → Tribune → Primus Pilus → Pilus Prior → Centurion → Optio → Decanus

**Integration:**
- In combat operations, Fleet provides transport and fire support
- Legion provides boarding parties and ground operations
- A fleet captain commands the ship; a legatus commands embarked legionaries
- Coordination happens through joint planning and communications
- At sector level, an Admiral and a Legion Commander (commanding multiple legions) coordinate under a Sector Commander

**Example: The Shield Doctrine Story**
- Commander Varro: Fleet Captain, commands the ship *Resolute*
- A Legatus would command the legion embarked on *Resolute*
- Captain Chen: Legion Centurion, commands boarding operations
- Varro and the Legatus coordinate ship movements and boarding tactics

## Usage Tips for Writing

**When introducing a character:**
- "Captain Marcus Chen, centurion of Third Century, Second Cohort"
- "The Primus Pilus strode into the briefing room" (no need to explain the rank every time)

**In dialogue, use simple terms:**
- "The centurion ordered his optio to reorganize the squads"
- "All cohort commanders, report to the Legatus"

**Save the Latin for formal occasions:**
- Roll calls, official ceremonies, written orders
- Otherwise, use "cohort commander" instead of "Pilus Prior"

**The key ranks readers need to know:**
- **Decanus** - squad leader (10 soldiers)
- **Centurion** - officer commanding 100 soldiers
- **Primus Pilus** - senior NCO of the entire legion
- **Legatus** - legion commander

Everything else can be explained contextually as needed.

## Notes on Terminology

**Latin terms to keep:**
- Legatus, Tribune, Primus Pilus, Centurion, Optio, Decanus
- These are distinctive and convey the Roman inspiration

**Terms you can translate in narration:**
- "Cohort commander" instead of always saying "Pilus Prior"
- "Legion commander" instead of always saying "Legatus"
- "Second-in-command" instead of always saying "Optio"

**Terms for specialists:**
- Signifer = standard bearer (you might rename this for your setting)
- Cornicen = horn blower (maybe "signals officer" or "communications specialist")
- Tesserarius = watch officer (keeps watch rotations, passwords)

Feel free to adapt specialist titles to fit your sci-fi setting - maybe the Cornicen becomes a "Communications Specialist" who manages squad-level comms instead of blowing a horn!
